If you don't watch the programme, you don't know the format.) is that it was nothing like a normal QT show. The usual format is that they bring up a topic in the news, allow a question or two from the audience and then discuss it. The  burning issue of that week was Royal Mail strikes but the programme never touched this.  It was not the topical debate/political programme it was before and has been since, it was a complete stitch-up. They do not normally question politicians on what they  have said or done in the past unless it is relevant to the actual news topic under discussion. It was an exercise in ""get Griffin"" and when he went in prepared to discuss the post strikes and whatever else was going on, they just laid into him from all sides in a never-seen-before-or-since deviation from the usual format."

Homeland Security officials have implied their hands are tied by court rulings in many cases, but the numbers, obtained by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, showed 57 percent of the criminals released were by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s own choice, and they could have been kept instead.  “Put aside the spin, and the fact is that over 17,000 of the criminal aliens released last year were released due to ICE discretion, representing 57 percent of the releases,” said Mr. Goodlatte. “The Obama administration’s lax enforcement policies are reckless and needlessly endanger our communities.”  Source Article from http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/black...ridCfCQ/M.html

Judging from what the Kurdish Agency BasNews and Reuters are reporting (below are the reports), de facto the United States, in violation of international law governing relations among nations, under the excuse of fighting Daesh (their creation) have occupied part of the territory of a sovereign state , Syria, without any mandate by Damascus, offering coverage even for some survivor factions of the so called ‘Free Syrian Army’, a jihadi gang undercover and allied under the table with al-Nusra Front.  The truth about creating this pirate base on Syrian territory is that the US is in practice already splitting the political and territorial integrity of Syria, making a completely illegal action, outside of any international mandate, within a project we can define a prerequisite for the Saudi-Qatari pipelines to Turkey and Europe.  In this context, with the sanctions laid down by the U.S. against the neighboring (to Europe) Russia, Europe will become increasingly dependent and enslaved to the dictatorial regimes of the Gulf and to the Turkish blackmails.  In this way, Europe not only participates as an accomplice of the horrendous crimes committed against the Syrian people, but also commits masochistic action, against its own interests. Not only because of the acquisition of oil more expensive and of poor quality, but also because increasing the migratory flow towards the European boundaries, because of population fleeing where the control by terrorist gangs strengthens and expands.  Will be Europe able to understand that if Syria falls, the one we know today, multi-ethnic and multi-religious under the presidency of Bashar al-Assad, even the very existence of the old continent, as we know it today, with its history, traditions and culture, will be soon put into question.

U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright last year had stopped enforcement of the law while she reviewed it, and on Friday she declared that it was unconstitutional. She cited previous court decisions that said abortions shouldn’t be restricted until after a fetus reaches viability, which is typically at 22 to 24 weeks.  “The state presents no evidence that a fetus can live outside the mother’s womb at twelve weeks,” the judge wrote.  By adopting a ban based on a fetal heartbeat, and not the ability to survive, the Arkansas Legislature had adopted the nation’s toughest abortion law last March. Two weeks later, North Dakota lawmakers passed a bill restricting abortions at six weeks — or before some women would know they’re pregnant. That law is on hold.  In her decision Friday, Wright said only a doctor could determine viability.  “The Supreme Court has … stressed that it is not the proper function of the legislature or the courts to place viability at a specific point in the gestation period,” Wright wrote.  Wright left in place a portion of the law that requires doctors to check for a fetal heartbeat and to notify the pregnant woman if one is present.  Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, had vetoed the bill, citing the viability standard. But Republicans, controlling the Statehouse for the first time since Reconstruction, overrode him with a simple majority vote.  read full article at source: http://www.dailystormer.com/us-judge...-abortion-ban/

The reason? It could be considered a public demonstration.  The New York Postreported that the guards told music teacher Martha Brown that the group needed a permit to sing.  “Some of the students were very upset and confused. I told the children, ‘This is a place where you need to respect authority even if you don’t understand it,’” Brown said.  The Waynesville Middle School choir was wrapping up their trip to New York City with a visit to the memorial at the World Trade Center, where both skyscrapers were destroyed after hijacked planes flew into them in a carefully planned terrorist attack.  A mother with the group filmed the interaction and posted it on Facebook. The video of their interrupted rendition of the National Anthem has received more than 300,000 views as of this publishing.  The choir had seen the Broadway musical “The Lion King” and sung at Saint John the Divine Cathedral. and Brown wanted to add a bit of history to the whirlwind trip.

False	Senior Member	Robert Ransdell	"              I would say it matters, not to a degree where we try to move to support some other political puppet to be elected but the enemy thinks it matters to some meaningful degree, who is in the WH, so it matters to me. Sure the office of President is just a position occupied by a Jew puppet, but they work to put the right figurehead in there, so I have interest just on that matter alone.  I personally believe that there will never be another White male in the WH again, with the exception of ""America's first"" faggot president, they would permit a White male fag to get elected to achieve that. The establishment now I predict will look to do a merry go round of all the ""firsts"" they can muster, first beaner, first woman, first asian, and probably at some point first Jew. Hopefully I am right, I would hope this would prove to move many Whites to simply lose faith in the system, not because it is anti-White or occupied by non-Whites, but simply because it is just not serious enough to even be supported, they will lose interest if the thing starts being like a reality show in that manner, something with a predetermined outcome. Of course we all know it already is.  You did mention one that I didn't beforehand consider which I would say might qualify a White man to pass as acceptable to our Jew overlords, a White male with a non-White spouse and some mongrel kids.   Just like how having bubba Clinton in office it trickles down to the population and is used to demoralize the decent segment. How many saw adultery as acceptable after Clinton was in office, even subconsciously. Well the same could result with those who now casually are against race mixing, and those would number in the millions.  I would say there would be no chance Rand Paul (no matter how much he prostitutes himself to the enemy), Huckabee, Romney, or any other White man without an overly obvious flaw in their being (not just simply being corrupt) would ever be put in a position to actually be elected as it stands now. Might be wrong but I don't think so."

1980522	2016-01-20 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Saudi and Qatari Governments Order All Muslims to Hate Americans	True	Senior Member	Ian Smith son	"As American talking heads continue to express their “moral outrage” at Donald Trump's call “for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,” perhaps they should first consider what the official position of foreign Muslim governments is on Americans—beginning with U.S. “friends and allies.”  As it happens, jihadi hate for non-Muslim “infidels” is not limited to the Islamic State, which U.S. leadership dismisses as neither a real state nor representative of Islam. Rather, it's the official position of, among others, Saudi Arabia — a very real state, birthplace of Islam, and, of course, ""friend and ally"" of America.  Saudi Arabia’s Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas[1]—which issues religious decrees that become law—issued a fatwa, or decree, titled, “Duty to Hate Jews, Polytheists, and Other Infidels.” Written by Sheikh Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz (d. 1999), former grand mufti and highest religious authority in the government, it still appears on the website.  According to this governmentally-supported fatwa, Muslims—that is, the entire Saudi citizenry—must “oppose and hate whomever Allah commands us to oppose and hate, including the Jews, the Christians, and other mushrikin [non-Muslims], until they believe in Allah alone and abide by his laws, which he sent down to his Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings upon him.”  To prove this, Baz quotes a number of Koran verses that form the doctrine of Loyalty and Enmity—the same doctrine every Sunni jihadi organization evokes to the point of concluding that Muslim men must hate their Christian or Jewish wives (though they may enjoy them sexually).  These Koran verses include: “Do not take the Jews and the Christians for your friends and allies” (5:51) and “You shall find none who believe in Allah and the Last Day on friendly terms with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger [i.e., non-Muslims]—even if they be their fathers, their sons, their brothers, or their nearest kindred” (58:22; see also 3:28, 60:4, 2:120).  After quoting the verses, Baz reiterates: Such verses are many and offer clear proofs concerning the obligation to despise infidels from the Jews, Christians, and all other non-Muslims, as well as the obligation to oppose them until they believe in Allah alone.  Despite documenting its official hatred for all non-Muslims (albeit on a website virtually unknown in the West), in the international arena, Saudi Arabia claims“to support the principles of justice, humanity, promotion of values and the principles of tolerance in the world,” and sometimes accuses the West for its supposed “discrimination based on religion.”  Such hypocrisy is manifest everywhere and explains how the Saudi government’s official policy can be to hate Christians and Jews—children are taught to ritually curse them in grade school—while its leading men fund things like Georgetown University’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (the real purpose of which appears to be to fund influential “Christian” academics to whitewash Islam before the public).  Our other “good friend and ally,” Qatar, also officially documents its hate for every non-Muslim—or practically 100% of America’s population. A website owned by the Qatari Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs published a fatwa titled “The Obligation of Hating Infidels, Being Clean of Them, and Not Befriending Them.”  Along with citing the usual Loyalty and Enmity verses, the fatwa adds that Christians should be especially hated because they believe that God is one of three (Trinity), that Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified and resurrected for the sins of mankind—all cardinal doctrines of Christianity that are vehemently lambasted in the Koran (see 5:72-81).  Incidentally, this same Qatari government-owned website once published a fatwa legitimizing the burning of “infidels”—only to remove it soon after the Islamic State justified its burning of a Jordanian pilot by citing several arguments from the fatwa.  In short, it’s not this or that “radical,” who “doesn’t represent Islam,” or isn’t a “real state,” that hates non-Muslim “infidels.” Rather, it’s the official position of the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which are presented to the American public as “friends and allies.”  This little discussed fact might explain why the majority of terrorism in America is committed by Muslimsand why the majority of Americans support Trump’s measures.  [1] The Committee is known by other English names including The Standing Committee for Scholarly Research and Fatwa, or The Committee for Research and Religious Edicts, or The Permanent Committee for Islamic Research & Verdicts, or The General Presidency of Scholarly Research and Iftaa,’ or in Arabic, al-Lajnah ad-Daa'imah lil-Buhooth al-'Ilmiyyah wal-Iftaa.

If you don't want to support a project, that's fine. But you seem to make a lot of posts suggesting no one send anyone donations. Isn't a certain group known for trying to stifle WN projects from being funded? Is that your goal?

The money will support the recruitment of more scholars who “would enrich diversity or contribute on another dimension of strategic importance,” according to a written statement by Yale’s president, Peter Salovey, and its provost, Ben Polak.  {snip}  Yale faced criticism last month for a lack of racial diversity among its faculty members. According to its campus newspaper, The Yale Daily News, a poster put up on the campus called attention to statistics reflecting a much higher representation of minorities among undergraduate students than among professors. Tamar Gendler, dean of Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said at the time that nearly a third of incoming professors in the 2014-15 academic year were members of minority groups.  The new effort includes work to expand training on implicit bias in faculty searches and in the tenure and promotion process, to improve the pipeline into academe for graduate students with underrepresented backgrounds, and to collect more data on faculty demographics at Yale. The university will also develop a website devoted to faculty diversity.  {snip}  Topics: Multiculturalism and Diversity, Race and Universities, Racial Preferences in Hiring  read full article at source: http://www.amren.com/news/2015/11/af...lty-diversity/

According to Lt. Freddie Turrentine with the St. Clair County Sheriff’s Department, drivers were asked to voluntarily offer samples of their saliva and blood for a study being conducted by the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation.  The drivers were compensated for their samples.  Download AudiobooksStart your 30-Day Free Trial today. Listen on your iPod or Mp3 Player! Audible.com  “They’ve got big signs up that says ‘paid volunteer survey’ and if they want to participate they pull over there and they ask them questions and if they are willing to give them a mouth swab they give them $10 and if they are willing to give them a blood sample they give them $50. And if they don’t do anything they drive off,” Turrentine explained to The Daily Caller.  Turrentine said that St. Clair County had five roadblocks from Friday afternoon through the early morning hours of Sunday. He added that Bibb County also had roadblocks of this kind.  Turrentine said that Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs asked the county to participate and that the funding for the study is coming from the National Highway Safety Administration.  “What they are trying to do is 60 sites across the country,” he said, explaining the study will be conducted from June to October and is meant to get a better understanding of inebriation patterns. (SEE ALSO: IRS seeks to buy hidden cameras, surveillance equipment)  “They are trying to get 75,000 participants with anonymous donations of blood — and they don’t know whose blood or whose swab it is — and they are trying to say, ‘OK, after this hour at night, out of these 75,000 people 10 percent of them had alcohol in their blood or 12 percent of them had some kind of narcotic in their blood. That is all they’re doing, for impaired driving,’” he explained.  Turrentine said he did not know how many people deputies sampled over the weekend but said that St. Clair County had completed its portion of the study and would not be putting up more roadblocks of that kind. He added that this was not the first time the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation had conducted a study in the county. The last such test was in 2007.  The Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation did not immediately respond to request for comment, nor did the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs.  The incident did cause a stir on social media with people voicing concern about the roadblocks.  Update — Tuesday 12:47 p.m. EST: After publication of this article, Bibb County Sheriff Keith Hannah offered more details about the roadblocks in his county Tuesday. Hannah told TheDC that there were five roadblocks in Bibb County this weekend. He stressed that the samples were given voluntarily and that this was not the first time the county had participated in a study of this kind.  “It was a voluntary thing and they were compensated if they gave a DNA sample or a blood sample. The study group compensated them for it. If the motorist wanted to participate they could. If they wanted to go on, they were free to do so,” Hannah said Tuesday   Read more: http://dailycaller.com/2013/06/10/of...#ixzz2Vwsp5VRY

Behind a barricade, a group of men wore the fringed Jewish prayer garment known as the tzitzit and held up anti-gay signs bearing the logo of a group calling itself the Jewish Political Action Committee.  “Judaism prohibits homosexuality,” one sign read.  But the men were not Jewish. They were Mexican laborers, protesting because they were paid to protest, said one of the men, who would not give his name.  Heshie Freed, a member of the political action committee, an Orthodox Jewish group based in Brooklyn, said that the men were supplementary troops, filling in for the Jewish students who would normally be called upon to demonstrate.  “The rabbis said that the yeshiva boys shouldn’t come out for this because of what they would see at the parade,” Mr. Freed said.  The group was fenced off from the parade, at Fifth Avenue and 15th Street, by the police. Parade-goers tossed open water bottles at the protesters and kissed defiantly in front of them.  “It’s been a lot of confrontation,” Mr. Freed said. “Whenever you have emotions, you have a situation.”  Late in the afternoon, a fight broke out. Bystanders said the gates separating the Jewish group opened and parade-goers swarmed in.  Jasmine Brob, 19, said an Orthodox Jewish man from the committee swung at her friend, and Ms. Brob punched the man in the eye.  “I ducked and then I swung at him,” she said.  The man, whose skin around his eye was red with a small cut, held his sign high. The group left shortly after.   http://www.nytimes.com/live/gay-prid...es-the-parade/

It’s Also Dr. Mo And The A-MAIZE-ing Chinese Corn Theft Scandal! By Allan Wall on March 22, 2014 at 9:26pm   On December 12, 2013, six Chinese nationals were indicted by in federal court in Iowa, charged with conspiracy to steal seed corn from three American agribusiness giants (DuPont Pioneer, Monsanto and LG Seeds). I first learned of this case from some of my nephews, who had read about it in Farm Journal. It shows that Chinese espionage includes not only military and industrial targets, but agricultural ones as well. It raises grave questions about our legal immigration and naturalization systems.  There is a delicious irony here. Corporate agribusiness has a lot to answer for in the demographic replacement of the American people. The Big Ag lobby has promoted cheap labor and Open Borders, which actually harms traditional American family farms, such as the one I grew up on. But Big Ag lobbyists don’t care. Now, though, our loose immigration and naturalizations policies are harming them.  The conspiracy first came to light when a DuPont Pioneer manager, driving through rural Iowa, spied a Chinese man digging in an unmarked test field:                         The FBI began an investigation that resulted in the indictment of Dr. Mo and five others.  Corn, also known as maize, scientific designation Zea mays, is used for feeding both humans and livestock. Maize is grown worldwide, but the U.S. produces 40% of it, mostly in the great Corn Belt of the American Midwest, which has been described as “the most productive agricultural civilization the world has ever seen”.  I grew up on an Oklahoma farm where we raised corn. My dad and brother grow it today. In my mind, there’s nothing like corn on the cob!  Zea mays was developed thousands of years ago by Indians in what is now southern Mexico, so you could say the crop owes its origin to genetic manipulation. In the 1930s, the majority of U.S. corn production switched over to hybridization. The main scientist behind hybrid corn: George Harrison Shull, who also founded the journal Genetics and who worked for a time at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (from which DNA discoverer James Watson, was notoriously forced out for speechcrime about Africa’s potential in yet another of the recent apparently never-ending series of PC atrocities).  In corn hybridization, agronomists inbreed lines of corn for several generations, then cross them to produce hybrids. Then the hybrids may be crossed with others to produce “double-cross hybrids”.  A patented inbred seed line takes 5 to 8 years to develop. It ca cost $30-$40 million.  China is the world’s second-biggest maize producer after the U.S. However, the Chinese have not been as successful as the Americans in hybridization. They have not developed a major maize hybrid since 2001.  Of course, if Chinese companies could simply steal American seed corn, they could short-circuit the process. Which is exactly what this team of Chinese corn thieves were doing.  So who is the mysterious Dr. Mo? His name is Mo Hailong (Chinese style), also known as Robert Mo, and he received his mechanical engineering doctorate from Kansas State University, in 2002. Of course, a Florida newspaper calls him a “West Boca Man” since he is a resident of Boca Raton, Florida. [West Boca man accused of stealing trade secrets from U.S. seed companies, By Brett Clarkson, Sun Sentinel, February 22, 2014]. But in fact he came to the US from China fifteen years ago. Remember how Mitt Romney wanted to “staple a green card” to the diplomas of foreign-born STEM graduates? Well, this STEM graduate did get a green card. And look what happened!  Mo is the Director of International Business of the Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, which in turn is part of the DBN group, which in turn has a subsidiary known as Beijing Kings Nower Seed S & T Co. Ltd. (BKNS).    Mo’s co-conspirators are 1.Wang Lei  (BKNS Vice Chairman) 2.Li Shaoming (BKNS CEO), 3.Ye Jian (BKNS research manager) 4.Lin Yong (BKNS employee)  5.Wang Hongwei, a dual citizen of China and Canada.  None of these individuals are currently in custody. It may be possible to extradite Wang Hongwei from Canada, but the U.S. and China have no extradition treaty.  Are there even going to be any repercussions for this Chinese company? These weren’t rogue employees: they were high-ranking officials. Some of the group were wiretapped and their conversation made it clear they knew what they were doing was illegal.  Co-conspirators Ye and Li were apprehended when they tried to fly to China, stuffing their luggage with seed corn hidden in microwave popcorn boxes, in grocery-type bags, even in pockets. The seed corn was confiscated—but they were allowed to continue to China.  Wang Hongwei, who may have known he was under surveillance, attempted to drive into Canada. When stopped, he also had corn kernels in envelopes in bags, along with notebooks with GPS coordinates and digital photos of corn fields. All this was confiscated—but Wang was allowed to continue to Canada.  Nearly half the confiscated seeds which were evaluated turned out to be inbred or parent line genetics. They were worth millions.  Mo has pled not guilty and is to face trial on March 31st. [One Suspect in Seed Theft Case Pleads Not Guilty, Farm Futures, February 7, 2014]  Mo’s lawyer, Xian Wang, is a resident of China but has a license to practice law in the state of New York and has received permission to defend Mo in Iowa.  Also in December, in a totally separate but similar case, the indictment of two other Chinese Ag scientists, was announced. [Chinese Men Arrested For Seed Tech Theft, Farm Futures, December 16, 2013,] These two were attempting to steal rice seed samples from a Kansas research facility belonging to Ventria Bioscience. Weiquang Zhang, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., actually worked for Ventria, while Wengui Yan, a naturalized American (!) was a geneticist working for the USDA (!!).They stole rice seeds, then passed them on to a Chinese delegation that had been visiting U.S. agricultural facilities.  So here are two separate cases of Chinese agricultural espionage exploiting our legal immigration and naturalization systems. How many others are there? Even the New York Times (!!!) speculates all this “could mean that the Chinese have long been stealing from American seed companies without getting caught.” [Designer Seed Thought To Be Latest Target By Chinese, By John Eligon And Patrick Zuo, February 4, 2014]  Our lawmakers ought to asking some hard questions:  1.How successful is our legal immigration system in selecting immigrants who will be assets to our nation? To ask the question is to answer it.  2.How carefully are potential citizens examined? Ditto.   3.What about all these international contacts between U.S. and Chinese companies? Are they supervised? Ha!  4. What about all these U.S.-Chinese exchanges and visiting delegations? What do you think?  5.What repercussions do China and its companies face for military, industrial and agricultural espionage? Hello Congress? Hello?  Why do I have the sneaking suspicion that these questions aren’t under any serious consideration—even by lawmakers who talk a lot about “national security”?

From what I've read, the people designing the ceremonies are basically socialist commies, and the ceremonies were notable for historical misrepresentations. That makes sense. Occult does not. Your views are why I detest christ-inanity. It provides cheap, dumb, wrong explanations that are the mental equivalent of junk food, but they're oh so tempting and tasty to the weak-minded.               It's an in your face celebration of the murder of the people in the Aurora theater using symbolism through dance with the Batman theme and dancers with hair that just happens to be identical to the shooter's in form and color.          Right. You are literally the only person on this forum who believes that. You believe it because you see connections that aren't there - paranoia. A rational person would realize that these ceremonies were devised before Holmes ever committed the act; he would also realize that what goes on in Aurora, Colorado, hardly has any interest or meaning to people in Britain. Believe it or not, not all events are related.               Why was that particular piece of choreography even in the closing ceremonies at all?          I don't know.                Does it not seem just a little bit odd to your oh so big brain and ego, Alex?          No. No more odd than the James Bond skit, or the 1,001 pop singers. That's how these things go. It's a celebration of mass culture, particularly the British aspects of it.               Of all things to put in an Olympic closing ceremony they put a Batman and Robin skit with several James Holmes look-a-like dancers?           First of all, I can't trust that that's even what that orange-haired thing is, given your consistent misinterpretations. Stipulating that it was, my response is, so what? Why would a communist show-designer in Britain want to celebrate a mass-murder in Colorado that happened AFTER he had designed his ceremony? Even if it happened before, what possible motive could he have to care about Holmes's act at all, let alone celebrate it? To a rational man - none.               It's more than just odd or a coincidence. Did someone not think it might be a bit insensitive to the families of the victims to have that not so subtle reminder of the murder of their loved ones?          You are paranoid. You fit reality to your fantasies. You ignore facts.   Don't you find it a little strange that literally not one other person on here agrees with you, even though they disagree on everything else? How do you interpret that? Is your brain just bigger than everyone else's? Why do you suppose everyone but you consistently fails to find all these remarkable connections?

The 2013 recipient was Rand Paul; 2014 was Bill Gates. This is our third annual award, and our first to a woman. Angela “The Iron Frau” Merkel this year distinguished herself in her willingness to submerge her people in a wave of unassimilable Muslim “migrants,” and for that, we name her White Renegade of 2015.   It turns out Enoch Powell was wrong. It seems that the supreme function of statesmanship, rather than providing against preventable evils, is to provoke them.  This is what this year’s honoree, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, has done. And no political leader has been so widely celebrated by the mainstream press and the global elite. She is Time and AFP’s Person of the Year, the Economist’s “indispensable European,” and “Mother” Merkel to a million of Syrian “refugees” and to the journalists who shill for them. She exemplifies the great dream of the post-European ruling class of the West: a political figure beyond politics, a national leader indifferent to nation, a moral visionary who defends the establishment. And just as medieval aristocrats could count on the Church to sanctify their power, so can Merkel count on today’s secular sermonizers to bless her efforts to turn Europe into a cheap-labor playground of bankers and merchants ruling over an Islamic underclass.  Mrs. Merkel began the year by ruling out debt relief for Greece, saying, “There has already been voluntary debt forgiveness by private creditors; banks have already slashed billions from Greece’s debt.” Her insistence that Greece essentially cede its freedom over fiscal policy in order to get a bailout and stay in the Eurozone led to catastrophic consequences. Unemployment in the Hellenic Republic is at about 24 percent, and a shocking 39 percent among people ages 25 to 34 with a college degree.  Of course, Greece is not without responsibility–even the main responsibility–for the crisis. But Mrs. Merkel’s primary goal seems to have been to protect German banks from the consequences of their own reckless lending. She hasn’t shown much sympathy for suffering Greeks.  Thus, the transformation from bankers’ enforcer to paragon of altruism has to be regarded with suspicion. And one can’t help but suspect Merkel had motives beyond moral signaling when she invited an unlimited number of Muslim immigrants into the Fatherland. When the crisis arrived on her doorstep, it was an opportunity to increase the power of the European Union over its member states.

Cheney and other families are also close and related. Bush family is also related with jewish religion, through freemasonry but not only. they follow some jewish teachings: http://www.texemarrs.com/images/bush_with_talmud.jpg  is not that they are 'jews' or 'semitics', but they follow freemasonry (judaism for gentiles) and some jewish teachings.   some of them have partial jewish blood (1/4, 1/8 or 1/16), others don't.  Bush junior and Bush senior are not jews, but the mother of Bush junior (Barbara Bush) could have some partial jewish blood, i don't know.  jews use this loyal and submissive gentiles as a front 'cover'  for their obvious control, so that many people blame 'illuminatti' that in fact is also jewish, and is nothing more than high freemasonry.   illuminatti is nothing but oligarchic and political closed nepotism for jews and loyal kosher 'goyim' related by close blood lines. this is the 'elite'.

1970385	2016-01-03 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Bermuda Triangle: Where the wealthiest Jews make their tax liability mysteriously disappear	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	"Hedge fund magnates Daniel S Loeb, Louis Moore Bacon and Steven A Cohen are among those exploiting a financial loophole to save a fortune through a private tax system, write Noam Scheiber and Patricia Cohen in a good old-fashioned piece of American journalism.  The billionaires have invested large sums in art and millions more in political candidates.  Allianz’s Global Wealth Report 2015 rated the US as the wealthiest - and most unequal - country in the world. The growing divide between rich and poor is driven by this sophisticated method for shielding their fortunes.  The NYT report says the so-called “income defense industry” consists of top-shelf lawyers, estate planners, lobbyists, and anti-tax activists exploiting (and creating) loopholes unavailable to middle or working class taxpayers.  Operating in the shadows of Washington and Wall Street, mostly in tax courts and private Internal Revenue Service (IRS) negotiations, NYT says the effect has been to create a kind of private tax system open to less than one percent of Americans.  The result is a significant drop in the level of tax paid by the highest earners, money that could be used to address the country's growing hunger and homeless problem.  When Bill Clinton was elected US President in 1993, the 400 highest-earning taxpayers in America paid nearly 27 percent of their income in federal taxes, according to IRS data.  By the time Obama was re-elected in 2012, this had fallen to below 17 percent.  At its peak, the top US tax rate was 94% in 1944 and 1945, but it's been on a steady decline since then.  NYT found that if the top 400 earners were taxed like an average American in 2012, their tax obligations would have doubled, not counting the income hidden through ""convoluted partnerships, high-end investment funds, opaque family trusts, and foreign shell corporations"".  The techniques applied are designed to be too complicated for regulators, the media, and the general public to understand, but NYT explains their principle is quite simple - convert one type of income into another type that’s taxed at a lower rate.  Loeb loves this technique and through a Bermuda-based reinsurance company he set up in 2013, he transforms ""his profits from short-term bets in the market"", taxed at roughly 40 percent, into capital gains, a nearly 50% drop in tax rate.  NYT adds this company is ""active in the insurance business, not merely a tax dodge"".  Charitable trusts purchasing a ""private placement life insurance policy"" is another way top earners reduce their tax, according to NYT.  Lawmakers in Congress managed to slip a provision past lobbyists in the October budget deal which gives the IRS more power to collect ""underpaid taxes"", but since the rules don't take effect until 2018, it gives ""the wealthy plenty of time to weaken them further"".  The IRS faced budget cuts and political pressure in recent years, losing 5,000 enforcement officers after funding was reduced by 15 percent between 2010 and 2014.    ----- snip -----   read full article at source: http://www.rt.com/usa/327781-bermuda...althiest-make/"

True	News Bot	NewsFeed	A national lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organization wants the federal government to start shaming religious schools that request exemptions from Title IX anti-discrimination rules.  In a report released Friday, the Human Rights Campaign claims that in the wake of the Obama administration’s determination that the federal Title IX law outlaws discrimination “based on gender identity and non-conformity to sex stereotypes,” several religious institutions of higher learning have begun taking advantage of a little-known provision in the law that allows for exemptions based on religious objections.  “There is an alarming and growing trend of schools quietly seeking the right to discriminate against LGBT students, and not disclosing that information publicly,” HRC President Chad Griffin said in a press release accompanying the report. “Prospective students and their parents deserve greater transparency, and we urge the Department of Education to take action by helping to increase accountability and to ensure that no student unknowingly enrolls in a school that intends to discriminate against them.”  Although the expanded definition of Title IX prohibits any institution that receives federal funding from, say, refusing to enroll or hire transgender individuals, the Human Rights Campaign claims to have identified 33 schools in 26 states that have received an official waiver from that restriction based on their religious affiliations, out of 56 such requests. The report also finds that 23 of those schools obtained an additional exemption allowing them to deny students and job applicants based on sexual preference.  “At the Human Rights Campaign, we believe that religious liberty is a bedrock principle of our country,” Griffin writes in the introduction to the report. “We also believe that no one should use faith as a guise for discrimination, and that all students deserve to enter a school environment knowing they will be protected.”  The report complains that under current law, “the Department of Education has little discretion to deny requests by religiously affiliated colleges and universities for an exemption under Title IX,” and suggests that not only should the Department require schools to “publicize the number of exemptions that are requested and received,” but also that it should publish an annual report of its own documenting those statistics.  Yet several individuals who are close to the issue told The Daily Signal that they see those proposals as a way of curtailing religious liberty in the name of tolerance.  “If we were unable to choose faculty members who both live out and have a traditional view of Christian sexual morality, then that really damages our ability to pursue our mission as an institution,” said Hunter Baker, a fellow for religious liberty at Union University, one of the schools listed in the report. “You’re making it illegal for us to insist on a Christian life and worldview.”  Noting that the university adheres to a  ----- snip -----   read full article at source: http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=7111

The Jews in charge of Ukraine are now going to change the official version of Ukrainian 20th century history to suit their Zio-agenda. They are set to pass laws banning “Nazi” and Communist symbols while promoting a fake nationalism within the country. They are only doing this to separate Ukraine from the Russian sphere of influence.  What makes this so stupid is that Soviet Communism originated from the Jewish financed Bolshevik revolution nearly 100 years ago. Somehow I doubt Jews like Petro Poroshenko and the other rats running Ukraine will mention this. Instead they’ll blame all of these past Jewish crimes on the Russians.  The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, is expected to sign a package of laws on “decommunisation”, recently passed by parliament, which will lay down an official version of Ukrainian 20th century history. The laws ban Nazi and Communist symbols and the “public denial of the criminal nature of the Communist totalitarian regime 1917–1991”; they open former KGB archives; replace the Soviet term “great patriotic war” with the European second world war, and provide public recognition to anyone who fought for Ukrainian independence in the 20th century.  Proponents say the legislation, based on other post-Soviet countries such as Poland and the Baltic states, is long overdue to free Ukraine of a painful past and create a new national identity based on events repressed or rewritten by the Soviet regime.  read full article at source: http://www.dailyslave.com/jews-runni...ir-zio-agenda/

Facebook is one of the most horrible websites on the planet.  It has been promoted and used as an instrument of subversion in countries unfavorable to Jews.  In White European nations, Facebook intentionally censors views unfavorable to Jews and promotes Cultural Marxist doctrines as evidenced by the 50+ gender types you can select as a user.  The Chinese should continue blocking Facebook.  They should also issue a ban to prevent Zuckerberg from ever entering their country again.  From AP:  Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a rare meeting with China’s propaganda chief, at a time when Chinese authorities are tightening control over their cyberspace.  Liu Yunshan told Zuckerberg in their meeting Saturday that he hopes Facebook can share its experience with Chinese companies to help “Internet development better benefit the people of all countries,” China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported. Zuckerberg was in Beijing to attend an economic forum.  China has called for the creation of a global Internet “governance system” and cooperation between countries to regulate Internet use, stepping up efforts to promote controls that activists complain stifle free expression.  Facebook and other Western social media, including Twitter, are banned in China. Zuckerberg has long been courting China’s leaders in a so far futile attempt to access the country with the world’s largest number of Internet users — 668 million as of last year.  There is currently no Twitter feed listed because we were banned by the faggots at Twitter after around three weeks.  They are sick individuals who hate free speech and believe in the virtues of Jewish Marxist doctrines.  This site was banned from the Disqus comment service because we were alleged to hurt feelings.  It is important to note that Disqus is run by a bunch of faggots in San Francisco who hate freedom.  We do not have a Facebook account because it is an organization run by horribly evil society subverting Jews like Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg who belong in concentration camps.

Jeffrey December 11, 2012  (CNSNews.com) - In the public schools in Detroit, Mich., according to the U.S. Department of Education, only 7 percent of the eighth graders are grade-level proficient or better in reading.  Some public school teachers in the City of Detroit and around the state of Michigan are reportedly taking a vacation or a sick day today to protest right-to-work legislation likely to be approved by the state legislature. Under current law, Michigan public school teachers must pay dues to the teachers’ union. If the right-to-work law is enacted, Michigan public-school teachers will be free to join the union and pay dues to it if they wish, but they will also be free not to join the union and not to pay it dues.  Detroit public-school eighth graders do even worse in math than they do in reading, according to the Department of Education. While only 7 percent scored highly enough on the department’s National Assessment of Educational Progress test in 2011 to be rated “proficient” or better in reading, only 4 percent scored highly enough to be rated “proficient” or better in math.  Statewide in Michigan, only 32 percent of public-school eighth graders scored grade-level proficient or better in reading, and only 31 percent scored grade-level proficient or better in math.  68 percent of Michigan public-school eighth graders are not proficient in reading and 69 percent are not proficient in math.  Over the past decade, Michigan’s public school have shown no improvement at all in teaching children how to read. In 2002 just as in 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Education, only 32 percent of Michigan public-school eighth graders scored proficient or better in reading.  The state’s public schools have made a slight improvement in teaching math. In 2000, only 28 percent of Michigan public-school eighth graders were proficient or better in math. By 2011, that had inched up to 31 percent.

1990708	2016-02-07 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	The Balkan Route. These are not sudden disorganized flights of refugees, but a perfectly coordinated and desired immigration.	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	"GalliaWatch: The Balkan route   TV LibertÃ©s au cÅ“ur des Balkans : lâ€™invasion  migratoire Â« tranquille Â» de l&#39;Europe !         TV LibertÃ©s au cÅ“ur des Balkans : lâ€™invasion  migratoire Â« tranquille Â» de l&#39;Europe !                In this 21-minute video from TV Libertés, posted at Novopress, the narrator explains precisely how the so-called refugees arrive in Calais. He follows the trajectory from departure to destination and exposes those who participate in the organization of this scheme to change the face of Europe. These include UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders, UNCHR, Save the Children, etc... The narrator begins:  Of the major events of 2015 history will retain the exponential increase in migratory waves. Whether one calls them migrants, refugees or illegals, their arrival constitutes a major impact on the substance of the European population. Immigrants are not new, be they legal or illegal who until recently reached Europe via Lampedusa. Crises and interventions in the Arab/Muslim world caused a great increase in the influxes into Europe, with figures in 2015 passing the one million mark. These waves were particularly encouraged by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who expressed her wish to welcome all war refugees into Germany.  Note: At this point Angela Merkel, in a video, explains that Germany will succeed in integrating them. Germany is rich, she says, there is work, the migrants know they will be well-treated.  How can anyone not understand after such a statement that for the migrants, Europe is theirs for the asking. These migrants take a new route, in much greater numbers than before: the Balkan route. From Turkey, they arrive by sea in Greece, then make their way to Macedonia and Serbia. Until October 2015, they penetrated the Schengen Space via Hungary, then on to Austria. The response to this new phenomenon was brutal: Victor Orban decided to build a fence between Hungary and Serbia, then between Hungary and Croatia. Despite the EU's criticism, Hungary received support from the Visegrad group that includes Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Visegrad sent border guards. After that, the migrants traveled through Slovenia and Croatia to Germany and the other rich countries of the European Union. Closing the Hungarian border made headlines in the international press, yet there is little talk at this point about the migratory waves in the Balkans: four thousand persons per day in winter, which makes about one and a half million for the year 2016. A low estimate, since the warm weather brings in more.  In order to understand this silence on the migratory waves that continue to pour into Europe, we'll take the Balkan route, the one taken by a million migrants these past several months, and by those who committed the killings in Paris in November 2015. In the images of 2015, when the route crossed through Hungary there was a feeling of chaos: train stations full of illegals, squatting, waiting to move on…  (scenes of filth and garbage on the roads). And we recall the vigorous reaction of Victor Orban, largely supported by his people… (A graph shows the reactions of the Hungarians: 95% believe Hungarian families come before the immigrants.)  How can we explain the absence of a reaction from the governments of the Balkans? (Here you see the Prime Minister of Serbia visiting a migrant camp.) How can we explain that this topic is marginal in these countries? It's in the small city of Sid, a Serbian commune on the Croatian border, that we will find the answer. Sid is a poor town, on the way we see trash, a common sight on the roads taken by migrants. It must be said that the quantity of trash is less than usual. Once in the town we find no immigrants. We're directed to the train station. That is where the migrants end their crossing of Serbia. In front of the station, the refugee center. We cannot get in without authorization. Same thing at the train station. We manage to get in on grounds that it is a railway border zone. So you have to be an illegal to walk around freely.  On the street by the train station, we meet older persons who live in the town. As migrants watch, they rummage through trash dumpsters for food and clothing left there by the migrants. We meet Ilena, a volunteer who understands why the movements of the migrants do not disturb the daily life of the city.  At this point Ilena speaks in English. This begins at about 7'30"".  After Ilena's words, the narrator resumes:  These are not sudden disorganized flights of refugees, but a perfectly coordinated and desired immigration. We leave Serbia for Croatia. Just after the Serbo-Croatian border, we cross through the village of Tovarnik. It was through this village, following the closing of the border between Hungary and Serbia in September 2015, that the illegals poured into Croatia, creating scenes of chaos. It was to prevent a repetition of such events, liable to arouse public indignation, that the waves of migrants are now organized. They are kept outside of the town centers, held back by a system of locks where every country in transit waits for the signal from the next country in order to allow the influx of migrants to move along in orderly fashion.  We arrive at Slavonski Brod, the second largest city of Slavonia, Croatia, a peaceful place… Walking through we see the traces of its history - buildings typical of the Hapsburg Empire, the less elegant Socialist structures… and the bridge destroyed during the 1990's and rebuilt. Not the slightest trace of migrants in the city. Except for the Red Cross volunteers and workers that we encounter at meal times or in the evening. The refugee camp is located a few kilometers from the city and we can enter. The camp was hastily built in October 2015 when the closing of the border between Hungary and Croatia no longer allowed the migrants into Hungary and they turned instead to Slovenia, crossing all of Croatia along the way. A notable point: the camp is outside of the central city, built on a railroad detour. It permits the transportation of migrants between Sid and Slavonski Brod. The migrants get off, are checked, and get back on in the direction of Slovenia. We arrived at the camp at 11:00 a.m.. It was impeccably clean. Yet two thousand had transited there in the morning. The spokesperson for the police explains:  - ""Thanks to the protocol between Croatia and Serbia, in Serbia the migrants are taken to the train station in Sid. From there they are brought directly by train here to Slavonski Brod. This is a winter transit camp. The migrants get off the train in the middle of the camp and get in line for registration. We do a complete registration: identity, photograph, finger prints. It is a detailed check. Then we give them food, clothing, everything they need. Then they get back on board for Slovenia. Yesterday (December 28, 2015) 3,249 migrants entered Croatia. This morning until 9:00 a.m. 2,097 migrants entered Croatian territory.  Since the beginning of the migratory crisis in September 2015, 549,915 migrants have entered Croatia. Since this camp in Slavonski Brod opened on November 13, 2015, 235,000 migrants have passed through. The past several days we've been getting three to four thousand migrants a day. The camp has a five thousand person capacity. The migrants stay here two and a half to three hours, enough time to register and get what they need before moving on to Slovenia. Every migrant can ask for asylum in Croatia, but few do. They come directly here, they have no contact with the population of the city. The transiting migrants therefore do not disturb the local residents.""  The narrator continues:  And that is how the migratory influx pouring into Western Europe passes in transit through the Balkans. Under the control of local governments and international organizations, in an orderly way that leaves nothing to chance.  After Slavonski Brod, they go to Dobova in Slovenia, then enter Austria. Finally, they arrive at their destination, Germany. Some go on to other destinations: Scandinavia, especially Sweden, and others pile up in Calais, with the goal of reaching England. For how long can this process go on? Germany has taken in only 10% of the total according to German minister Gerd Müller. Eight to ten million more are expected. The potential seems infinite… Tomorrow there will be a demographic explosion in Africa that today has a billion inhabitants, but it will double or triple by 2050.  For how long will Angela Merkel be able to shout repeatedly ""We can do it""? For how long will European leaders and other NGO's go against governments and their people who oppose this colonizing wave and want the right to decide with whom they want to live? To conclude our grim tour of the Balkans we go to Hungary, to Asotthalom a small village on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where land and farms stretch out over many kilometers, where more than 100,000 migrants passed in 2015. We meet the mayor of this village László Toroczkai who has been on the front lines from the start of this migration in the autumn of 2015. He was the first to suggest the construction of a barrier to stop the influx: ""Beginning September 15, 2015 illegal crossing of the Hungarian border is a crime. Damaging the border barrier is also a crime. Now Hungary's borders are protected by a border that is constantly being built and by several thousand police and Hungarian soldiers. On the territory of Asotthalom they are supported by a team of rural and civilian guards.""  After a year of chaos, this little village has recovered its calm, its cleanliness… László Toroczkai gives his opinion on the divisions within the European Union regarding the migratory crisis:  ""It's clear that the four members of Visegard are the last hope for Europe. The four of us are united not only in words but in actions. For example, here in Asotthalom the Polish, Czech, Slovakian and Hungarian police guarded the border together. They've all gone back home, because the Hungarian police and army are more than adequate to guard the border. It appears that Visegard, that was once a small entity with little meaning, is about to become, as a result of the crisis, a very strong alliance, perhaps eventually military, as well as a bastion of the European Union. Here we are on the border of the European Union, on the Schengen borders. The question is: does the European Union want these four countries as well as any others that may join them, such as Croatia, if it ever gets a patriotic government, or even Slovenia; but the big question is: does Western Europe want to work with these countries that are ready and able to defend Europe? I think that illegal immigration will be, in Western Europe, what wakes people up and makes them realize that the EU is moving in the wrong direction and perhaps Germany will remove Angela Merkel. Only the German people can remove Merkel. Just as only the French people can remove their traitorous government. I cannot help them with that, it's up to French and German voters to decide. But if Western Europe needs the Visegrad four and those who might join it, to protect Europe with all their might, then the European Union has a future. If, on the other hand, Western Europe does not need these countries that could eventually coalesce from Finland to Croatia on the borders of Europe, if Western Europe does not want Central Europe, then I can well imagine that the future European Union will be split in half, and Western Europe will be alone with its tens of millions of immigrants on its hands.""

As such he received considerable attention from his captors, was referred to by his fellow prisoners as the “Crown Prince,” and was handled with kid gloves.  McCain’s own tale of his torture and the confession he recorded for the North Vietnamese comes largely from his book, Faith of My Fathers, in which he describes his shame at cooperating with the enemy. But some of McCain’s fellow prisoners, who were tortured and did not collaborate, have challenged his narrative, expressing their belief that McCain was not physically abused at all and that he was well treated.   by McCain’s own account he began cooperating with the North Vietnamese within three days of his capture and was fully on board within two weeks, providing specific intelligence on his aircraft carrier, its aircraft, and the support vessels attached to it, information that was later featured in North Vietnamese radio broadcasts. One account that appeared on a wire service entitled “PW Songbird is Pilot Son of Admiral” reported that McCain may have gone beyond an acceptable level of collaboration in assisting the psychological warfare offensives aimed at American servicemen.  On one occasion, General Vo Nguyen Giap, the top Vietnamese commander and a nationalist celebrity of the time, personally interviewed McCain. His compliance during this command performance was a moment of affirmation for the Vietnamese. His Vietnamese handlers thereafter used him regularly as prop at meetings with foreign delegations.  “McCain told his North Vietnamese captors, highly classified information, the most important of which was the package routes, which were routes used to bomb North Vietnam. He gave in detail the altitude they were flying, the direction, if they made a turn… he gave them what primary targets the United States was interested in…the information McCain provided allowed the North Vietnamese to adjust their air-defenses. As result…the US lost sixty percent more aircraft and in 1968 [and] called off the bombing of North Vietnam, because of the information McCain had given to them.”  One might reasonably infer that McCain’s cover up of Vietnam era POW sightings could well have been driven by fear that some released prisoners might have unpleasant things to say about his activities while at Hoa Lo prison.  much more at: John McCain: War Hero or Something Less?"

1811164	2015-03-15 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Iran Mass Produces Long-range Anti-ship Qadir Cruise Missile	False	Senior Member	Joe_Smith	"Shia Islam is based on hierarchy and a Plato-like guardian class of theologians and philosophers that are allowed to oversee parliament and its adherence to the ideology of their revolution. The Qu'ran says nothing about transexuals, because I doubt muhammad could even imagine such a vile thing was even possible, so the Iranians see the issue as one of individual will. The legalization of birth control that was largely responsible for the massive drop in their birth rate was also based on the fact that the Qu'ran does not specify any ban on it, but they learned their lesson on the restrictions of dogma and are going to legislate against it anyway.   Aside from marginal puritanical and hypocritical elements like the ISIS salafists (which certainly have Christian equivalents, like Baptists), Islam in general is not as restrictive as some think. In fact, unlike the Old Testament, Muslims are allowed to practice oral sex as long as they are married.  It's really just another religion not really any different from historical Christianity, and it is undergoing a revival in virility and combativeness because A) it provides a clear doctrine for ""just war"" unlike pre-Augustine Christianity and B) Israel and America have literally destroyed half the region for no coherent reason, and murdered millions of their people.  If someone was carpet bombing Sweden, Italy, or Germany, wouldn't you be compelled to go there and fight in a holy war for your brothers?   Some of the excesses committed by Muslims has more to do with their race and culture than anything else. The Christian Donatists in North Africa, who were descended from war-like Berbers, were just as fierce before the Saracens as they were after when they all converted to Islam. It's safe to say the Islam of Boko Haram in Nigeria is not the Islam practiced in more civilized countries like Iran, Syria, or Lebanon.  The retards talking about ""looming Sharia"" like George Witzgall seem to always omit the fact that armed and political entities in countries like Pakistan and Egypt haven't even been able to impose Sharia law, even though they are operating in territories that are 95% Muslim.   I have a really hard time believing sex changes are common in Iran, George's link says that it amounts to a few hundred in a nation of 80 million. It sounds like Jewish freudian calumny like the ""finding"" that Iran and the Middle East are the largest consumers of gay porn.                            Witzgall is a self-proclaimed homosexual. Which is why you only see him pop up to ideologically ""police the scene"" like some Antifa faggot in Iran threads.   Queers tend to be smarter than average, so he knows how to hit the right buttons with some frothing at the mouth, reactionary Texas-style white nationalists in America: ""IRANIANS ARE JUST FILTHY SAND NIGGERS, WE OUTTA NUKE EM, WE NEED TO SUPPORT JEWS  AGAINST THEM CUZ SOME OF THEM GOT BLUE EYES!!!""."

The first two planes will reach Israel in about six months, with another 17 arriving by the end of 2017. At that point, the IDF's F-35 squadron will begin operations.  The jet is so innovative that a senior Air Force officer was quoted as saying that it could even serve as a first-rate intelligence plane due to its information processing systems and sensors. It can decrypt any enemy radar signal long before it is recognized, allowing it to operate far from Israeli territory without the fear of discovery.  A senior official in the Air Force noted that all classified communications systems used in the jets will be produced in Israel.

Pollard, who was jailed in 1987 after he admitted to passing classified information to Israel, would be released on Nov. 21 when he is eligible for parole, according to the source, who did not wish to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.  The release would come at the 30th anniversary of his arrest and amid a number of reports in recent years of his ill health and hospitalization. Pollard will be 61 years old on Aug. 7 and is being held at a federal prison in Butner, N.C.  The source stressed that the release is not connected in any way to the Iran nuclear deal announced this week on Tuesday, which has been a major source of tension between the U.S. and Israel.  There will be “no special exemptions,” the source said.  Last November, a group campaigning for the release of Pollard said a parole board denied a request to free him after American officials said the release would send the wrong message, The Times of Israel reported. At the time, the group said it would release information pointing to the White House’s attempts to prevent Pollard from going free, according to the report.  Pollard canceled a parole board hearing at the last minute in April 2014 amid reports that his release could be secured as part of a political deal at the time to salvage U.S.-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, The Times of Israel said.  Pollard is believed to be the only American ever to receive a life sentence for passing classified information to an ally of the United States. Israeli officials, American and Israeli activist groups, and American politicians who see his punishment as unfair have lobbied continuously for a reduction or commutation of his sentence.  read full article at source: http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/07/17...ter-this-year/

Obama, in a wide-ranging interview with Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic, said that his criticism of Netanyahu, who on election day warned in a frantic video that Israel’s Arab citizens were streaming to the polls “in droves,” related to the very “nature of the friendship between the United States and Israel.” He also said that comments such as Netanyahu’s have “foreign-policy consequences.”  That criticism, which rattled the already fraught relationship between the two governments, was due to Netanyahu straying from “the very language of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, which explicitly states that all people regardless of race or religion are full participants in the democracy,” said Obama, who also took Netanyahu to task for asserting in the run-up to the election that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch.  Both statements by the prime minister appeared geared to rally right-wing voters, although the comment about Arab voters was also widely criticized as racist. Days after the comments were made, the prime minister apologized while speaking to a group of representatives of the Arab community who he invited to his office.  Obama at the time slammed Netanyahu for his remarks, saying they were “contrary to what is the best of Israel’s traditions,” and that it “erodes the name of democracy in the country.”  “When something like that happens, that has foreign-policy consequences, and precisely because we’re so close to Israel, for us to simply stand there and say nothing would have meant that this office, the Oval Office, lost credibility when it came to speaking out on these issues,” he told Goldberg on Tuesday.  “And when I am then required to come to Israel’s defense internationally, when there is anti-Semitism out there, when there is anti-Israeli policy that is based not on the particulars of the Palestinian cause but based simply on hostility, I have to make sure that I am entirely credible in speaking out against those things, and that requires me then to also be honest with friends about how I view these issues.  “My hope is that over time [the] debate gets back on a path where there’s some semblance of hope and not simply fear, because it feels to me as if, if all we are talking about is based from fear,” he said.  Obama conjured many of Israel’s most iconic figures and symbols to stress his long-standing support and admiration for the Jewish state.  “I care deeply about preserving that Jewish democracy, because when I think about how I came to know Israel, it was based on images of… kibbutzim and Moshe Dayan, and Golda Meir, and the sense that not only are we cre  ----- snip -----   read full article at source: http://www.timesofisrael.com/obama-u...-to-defend-it/

That said, Netanyahu stressed that Israel ensures that Jerusalem will be an open and tolerant city.  “Only under Israeli rule is the freedom of worship in Jerusalem guaranteed for all religions,” he said. “Believers pray at their holy sites, not despite our control over the city but because of it.”  The prime minister described Jerusalem as a “touchstone that puts us to the test: To what extent are we willing to hold onto it and defend it?”  Netanyahu vowed that Israel will never come to terms with terror and will hunt down its proponents. “We will fight incitement, which stems from denial of our attachment to Jerusalem and our heritage.”  “Who opposes our presence in Jerusalem?” the prime minister asked. “Those who refuse to accept out right to live as a sovereign nation in our country. They regard us as a foreign weed that needs to be pulled out of this ground.”  In a more conciliatory speech, President Reuven Rivlin said that, while Jerusalem for him is both “Zion and Zionism,” it doesn’t belong only to its history.  “It belongs first and foremost to its people, to all its residents – secular, religious and Haredi; Arabs and Jews,” Rivlin said. “In united Jerusalem there is a west and an east. It has no step-children.”  “We must be honest with ourselves when we look at the massive gulf between the west of the city and the east,” the president urged his audience. “We may have united the city, but we have barely begun the task of bringing about its economic and social unity.  “While western Jerusalem is achieving impressive progress and development, in the east we find neglect and despair.”  Clashes in Damascus Gate  Netanyahu and Rivlin’s speeches were made as an annual ‘flag march’ made its way through the Old City, sparking clashes between Palestinians and police and between Jewish and Palestinian protesters.  The flag march, held by national-religious participants, passed through the Muslim quarter of the Old City after a petition by left-wing groups to change its route was rejected by the High Court of Justice.  The last few days have seen a concerted effort by rabbis, police commanders and organizers of the march to persuade participants to abstain from violence, which characterized such events in previous years. Hundreds of policemen are expected to secure the march, while leftist activists from an organization called “Jerusalem Won’t Tolerate Racism” are planning a demonstration opposing the march of flags.

If a “final decision” in this regard is not taken by then, the group has said, they will ensure that the Bulgarian and Macedonian borders with Greece are closed, strangling the “Balkans route” being used by the invaders.  In a statement issued after their joint meeting on Monday in Prague, the Visegrad Four—Bohuslav Sobotka (Czech Republic), Beata Szydlová (Poland), Viktor Orbán (Hungary), Robert Fico (Slovakia), along with Gjorge Ivanov (Macedonian President), and  Boyko Borissov (Bulgarian Prime Minister)—released a statement saying the future of the European Union (EU) depended upon securing its external borders.  In their statement, the leaders demanded that the Macedonian and Bulgarian borders with Greece be closed “should the Greek and Turkish governments fail to meet their obligations” to halt the invasion.  Such a move would in effect create an EU buffer zone on Bulgaria’s and Macedonia’s borders, even though the latter is not a member of the EU and Bulgaria is not a member of Schengen. It would also cut off Greece—which is an EU member.  The reason why the V4 group has come up with this plan is because they obviously do not believe that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s plans involving Turkey and Greece will bring results.  A final decision, the V4 group has said, must come in March, and if by then there are no signs of improvement—that is, if Turkey and Greece have not lived up to their promises—then they will take steps to shut the border.  The presence of the Macedonian President and Bulgarian Prime Minister at the V4 meeting means that they have already agreed to this plan—which clashes directly with Merkel’s “open borders” pro-invasion stance.  The official V4 statement said that “Unless we put the decisive steps rapidly into practice and thus improve the management of the most exposed parts of the European Union’s external borders and stem the migratory flow, the situation risks deteriorating beyond our control.  “Such a development would put the cornerstones of the European integration, especially Schengen and the principle of free movement, at risk. Stepping back in this area would question the very foundations of the European Union and would have strong negative economic, social, and symbolic impacts. Moreover, it would also produce harmful effects for the security and stability of the Balkans region.”  The V4 statement is likely to be hotly debated at the “EU summit on migration” due to begin on Thursday this week, with the majority of German newspapers already viewing the threat to shut the border with Greece as a “rebellion against the migration policies of Chancellor Merkel.”  Die Welt newspaper, for example, reported that the V4 meeting had “strongl  ----- snip -----   read full article at source: http://newobserveronline.com/visegra...rkel-showdown/

Many of the claims, such as the refrigerator, traffic light, ect. are completely false. Others like George Washington Carver, only took out patents for his own version of existing inventions, none of which were ever commercially successful. Others falsely give sole credit to one person, when multiple people are named in the patent.  However, one African-American mega-star inventor has been completely left out! Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa. He obtained Canadian citizenship when he was 17 and eventually moved to the United States. This great African-American is a modern day Thomas Edison, because he has the ability to create ground breaking products and is a highly successful businessman (many of the greatest inventors died poor).  This African American made $22 million off of a software company he co-founded within a matter of a few years. He went on to co-found Paypal, SpaceX, and become CEO of Tesla Motors!  Elon Musk funded the software company Zip2 with his brother. Musk received $22 million when the company was purchased by Compaq. Musk then co-founded X.com, which later merged with Confinity and was re-branded as PayPal. Musk received $165 million from the sale of PayPal to Ebay.  If that wasn’t enough, Elon Musk then co-founded SpaceX which has put NASA to shame and reshaped the future of space exploration. SpaceX has shown that private companies will probably dominate space exploration in the future, not bloated government bureaucracies.In 2012, SpaceX became the first private company to have a vehicle dock with the International Space Station. The vehicle used transported cargo to the station at a fraction of the price of anything ever created by NASA. SpaceX intends to transport humans into space in the near future.  Musk became CEO of Tesla motors in 2008. This man him a front man on the cutting edge of both private sector space exploration and some of the world’s most advanced electric cars.  Yet all of this was not enough. Musk started another company called SolarCity to design advanced solar panels. If that wasn’t enough, Musk started a project called Hyperloop. This would be a futuristic airtube transport system that would allow commuters to go from Los Angeles to San Francisco in thirty minutes.       read full article at source: http://topconservativenews.com/2014/...r-of-our-time/

True	News Bot	NewsFeed	Left-leaning student activists at Oberlin College hung posters at the Christina Hoff Sommers event earlier this week that identified the students involved in bringing the individualist-feminist and AEI scholar to campus.  Each poster gave the name of a specific student-member of the Oberlin College Republicans and Libertarians and accused that person of perpetuating rape culture.  Images of the posters were sent to Reason via a source who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation. The last names of the students identified by the posters were blurred before Reason received them.  According to the source, a group of approximately 10 student-activists were behind the posters.  They have the right to denounce their fellow students as perpetuators of rape culture, I suppose, though the fact that some students would smear others with this charge for merely bringing a speaker to campus is disappointing. Do students no longer recognize that the entire point of challenge is to grapple with new and different ways of thinking about the world?  Over at The Washington Post, David Bernstein wonders when—and how—the idea of seeking physical safety from uncomfortable ideas arose on college campuses:  Just today I learned (via Hans Bader) that Oberlin, supposedly one of the great liberal arts colleges in the world, has been in a tizzy because of a speech by the rather mainstream conservative feminist Christina Hoff Summers, which supposedly made students feel “unsafe” well in advance. And so on.  In no examples that I have seen has there been any actual threat or prospect of violence against the students complaining that they feel “unsafe.”  This is a huge threat to the future of free speech nevertheless. Today’s college students are going to be tomorrow’s judges, and if they truly believe that “safety” means “never having to deal with opinions that disagree with one’s cherished beliefs,” then censorship has a good chance of gaining the upper hand over freedom of speech. After all, public safety can be a justification for suppressing speech, as with the “fighting words” doctrine.   read full article at source: http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/23/ob...s#.lh8xcq:GvVE

Yet, as CowgerNation reports, facts show that violent crime and homicide rates increase after gun bans are enacted.  “If congress had passed some common sense gun reforms after Newtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their own classroom, reforms that 90% of the American people supported, we wouldn’t have prevented every act of violence, or even most, we don’t know if it would have prevented what would have happened in Charleston, but we might still have some more Americans with us,” Obama said.  “I know today’s politics less like that we will see any serious gun safety legislation. Ultimately, congress will follow the people. At some point in the country, we have reckon with what happens. It’s not good enough to show sympathy. You don’t see murder on this kind of scale, with this kind of frequency, in any other advanced nation on Earth. Every country has violent, hateful, or mentally unstable people. What’s different is not every country is awash with easily accessible guns. I refuse… to pretend that it’s simply sufficient enough to grieve, and that any mention of us doing something to stop it is somehow politicizing the problem.”  “We need a change in attitudes, among attitudes: lawful gun owners, those who are unfamiliar with guns. We have to have a conversation about it and fix this. And ultimately congress acts when the public insists on action.  And we’ve seen how public opinion can change. We’ve seen it change on gay marriage, we’ve seen it beginning to change on climate change. We have to change how we think about this issue. We as a people have got to change.”  During his speech, Obama also took time to capitalize on the racial aspect of the Charleston shooting to further the racial tension that is currently brewing.  Every year, guns are used over 80 times more often to protect a life than to take one!  Yet who am I to posts facts on the matter.

From the daily mail:  (Note - should be WHETHER there are other bombs and is there a cell!)  The alleged Boston Marathon bomber is awake and responding to questions in his hospital bed. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is responding sporadically in writing to questions from investigators regarding other cell members and other unexploded bombs, law enforcement sources told ABC News.  The 19-year-old shoved his pistol in his own mouth and pulled the trigger as SWAT officers and federal agents closed in on the boat where he was hiding on Friday night. However, instead of killing him, the bullet simply tore through his neck. Authorities initially said they couldn't question him because of the throat wound. CNN reports earlier today that Tsarnaev was 'intubated and sedated' at a Boston hospital. The Boston police commissioner said Tsarnaev is in 'critical but stable' condition on Sunday - which appears to be a downgrade from reports earlier this weekend that his condition was only 'serious.' Boston Mayor Tom Menino revealed that federal agents may never be able to interview Tsarnaev. Menino didn't elaborate on his comment and it is unknown whether the gunshot also caused brain damage. Police sources told MailOnline that investigators are looking into the possibility that Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan had a suicide pact so that neither of them could be taken alive and put on trial. Authorities believe Dzhokhar likely killed him brother, who was handcuffed, when he ran over him.

1857349	2015-06-13 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Student with oompa loompa tan accused of wearing 'blackface' in high school yearbook	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	SHORELINE, Wash. – A picture of a white female Shorewood High School student with a bad tan and the cutline “do you think this is my color” caused so much racial strife the district is putting stickers over the image.  Officials with the Shoreline School District issued a formal apology for the yearbook photo of a pouting white teen with a dark, obviously fake complexion after the image circulated on social media and offended many people. Some claim the picture resembles blackface, and the backlash against the teen has been relentless, King 5 reports.  “There have been some pretty mean comments. Some people have actually been telling her to go kill herself,” junior Case Macklin told the news site.  “I know she didn’t mean it to be offensive,” Macklin told KREM 2. “She didn’t mean blackface like in an offensive way, she just meant it like she had a bad tan.”  “She was just snapchatting back and forth with her friend and put a whole bunch of Claire’s bronzer on,” said junior Trevor Corwin. “It wasn’t meant to be offensive.”  In fact, the student herself took to Twitter to clear the air. She explained she wasn’t being racist, but poking fun at her own bad tan from the salon and apologized. It didn’t matter, her comments only drew more scorn.  “Nah it ain’t your color STOP DOING BLACKFACE,” wrote a Twitter poster NaQuelBy10o, according to the New York Daily News.  “UR ONLY SORRY BOUT THE PIC CAUS UR ASS GOT CALLED OUT ON IT, WHY WOULD U EVEN BE OK WIT PUTTING THAT IN A YEARBOOK?” amir-uh tweeted.  Ku-Reem posted “The cracker race strikes again,” and ChrisB. tweeted that the backlash and apology “is like poking a bear then crying and getting mad when it bites you.”  “What you did was wrong so just own up to it,” queen ivy wrote.  The controversy prompted the school district to take action, but not to stop the online harassment.  Instead, officials apologized for the yearbook image, and stopped handing out the yearbooks. They ultimately decided to put some sort of sticker of the image in the remaining yearbooks, and announced that students offended by the picture can pick up a sticker to put over it, King 5 reports.  “It’s clearly hurtful,” Shoreline schools spokesman Craig Degginger told the news site. “That image should not have been included in the Shorewood High School yearbook.”  The district now plans to investigate how the image got past two adult yearbook advisors.  Nearly everyone who commented on the King 5 story thought the whole issue was preposterous.  “I’m so sick of political correctness. Oh your feelings are hurt. Oh my God, how terrible. Let’s put a sticker over it. Jesus Christ!! Grow up!” Joe Molitor posted.  “Are you serious? Orange is racist? The girl is orange, are Oompa Loompa offended?” Katie Wynn wrote. “Wow. Shorewood you guys need a reality check.”  “OMG look up the definition of ‘black face.’ Clearly, that’s not what this girl is doing! Get off the freakin Victim Train peeps!

2014141	2016-03-21 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	S. Nasrallah: Hezbollah Will Strike Israeli Nuclear Facilities during Any War	True	Member	frenkel	"Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah on Monday threatened the Zionists of striking all their petrochemical factories, biological institutes and nuclear stores as well as facilities if the Israeli army launches a major war against Lebanon.  In an interview with Al-Mayadeen TV channel, Sayyed Nasrallah eliminated the possibility of any Israeli war against Lebanon in the short term, noting that the Zionist entity does not carry ot any military move without the American approval.  Sayyed Nasrallah reminded that in 2006, the US administration ordered the Israeli government to launch a war against Lebanon.  Sayyed Nasrallah considered that the logical, factual and realistic interpretation eliminates the possibility of any imminent Israeli war against Lebanon, but that if the Israeli officials decide to launch an adventure, the outcome may differ.      His eminence noted that the Israelis do not launch any war on the basis of Arab demands, but that some Arab regimes and spies work for the sake of the Israelis.  According to Sayyed Nasrallah, the Israelis do not start any war if they are not sure that the it can attain its goals with the minimum extent of losses and costs.  Hezbollah managed through his achievements and capabilities to convince the Zionist entity that any war it launches against Lebanon is very costly, Sayyed Nasrallah said.  ""The Israelis do not abandon the hostages and corpses taken by their enemies; this gives a chance for the Resistance to press the Zionist entity through this factor.""  In this context, his eminence added that the Israelis know that Hezbollah possesses rockets that can reach all the occupied Palestinian territories, noting that Hezbollah will employ his capabilities only in case of an Israeli attack.  The Israelis have been facing a deadlock since I threatened that Hezbollah would strike Ammonia tanks in Haifa because the Zionist government failed to move them to any other city due to the public rejection, his eminence pointed out.  Sayyed Nasrallah added that the Israelis built during the recent decades petrochemical factories, biological institutes and nuclear  reactors in residential areas, considering that the Zionist entity did not expect that there would be any Arab force that can strike them.  ""Either it relied of Arab regimes' guarantees or it positively expected that most of the Arab countries would not strike those targets.""  Sayyed Nasrallah said that the all the Israeli measures (Iron Dome, etc.) to deter the Resistance will fail, adding that any Israeli war against Lebanon would very costly because Hezbollah will use very sophisticated weaponry to strike all the Zionist targets without any limit if Israel attacks Lebanon.   To the Israeli officials who are threatening of destroying Lebanon in a way that it will back off dozens of years, Sayyed Nasrallah asked, ""Where would your entity be if Hezbollah strikes all these targets that he has all the details about their positions and coordinates?""  His eminence addressed the Zionist settlers, ""Ask your government that does not care about you to move the dangerous facilities from the residential areas.""  Hezbollah leader asserted that teh party will never grant the Zionist entity security guarantees, noting that the Resistance aims at preventing the Israelis from attacking Lebanon.  Sayyed Nasrallah responded to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's threat that the Zionist entity will not let Hezbollah obtain game-changing weaponry, by stressing that the Resistance and the Lebanese army has the right to get all the weaponry that can defend Lebanon.  ""What is ironic is that Israel possesses nuclear weaponry and some parties criticize the Resistance if it tries to obtain defensive weapons.""  ""Hezbollah follows up all the Israeli preparations for any war despite the Syrian war.""  About the possibility that the Israeli army might launch limited  strikes against certain targets in Lebanon without leading a major war, Sayyed Nasrallah warned the Zionists that such small battles will be also costly for them that the Resistance will not accept changing the deterrence formula with the entity and wasting the achievements of the mujahidin and the sacrifices of the martyrs.  Sayyed Nasrallah said that despite the fact that the Lebanese are nowadays occupied with the Israeli cyber violation, tehy have to also care about the Zionist aerial infringement that is being carried out on daily basis.  The Israeli drones are the enemy's eyes that it uses to prepare for the upcoming war because it monitors all the Lebanese territories,"" his eminence added, ""If the Lebanese government does not take any actions against the Israeli aerial violation for our sovereignty and security the Resistance will search for a solution for this major breach.""     ""Hezbollah is not concerned with receiving the Israeli reassurances or threats; only the idiots launch a war against Lebanon.""  In a different context, Sayyed Nasrallah considered that the Saudi decision to blacklist Hezbollah represent an Arab cover for any Israeli war against Hezbollah and Lebanon.  ""Some Arab leaders asked the Israelis during 2006 war to continue its war against Lebanon and Hezbollah.""  ""The Arab and Islamic peoples still support the Resistance despite all what has been done to distort Hezbollah image,"" Sayyed Nasrallah added, ""They are part of the axis of Resistance which includes Syria, Iraq, Iran, factions of Palestinian resistance (regarding fighting the Zionist entity) in addition to Hezbollah.""  ""In Syria, Russia has joined the axis of resistance though it is not part of it in all the domains.""  Regarding the Russian military intervention in Syria, Sayyed Nasrallah explained that this decision was being mulled among Tehran, Moscow and Damascus for six months before taking it, noting that Hezbollah was informed about the developments of the related talks.  ""The decision was discussed among the leaders of Syria, Iran and Russia and it had nothing to do with urgent developments.""  ""A coordination and operations room was established by Russia, Iraq, Iran and Syria in Baghdad to lead the confrontation in the region.""  His eminence explained the Russian military withdrawal, saying that Russia intensified its military deployment in Syria in preparation for any Russian-Turkish confrontation after Turkey downed a Russian warplane.  His eminence noted that Turkey has never violated the Syrian airspace after Russian threatened to down any warplane that violates Syria sovereignty.  ""So after the tension between Turkey and Russia decreased, the latter withdrew the forces that were summoned upon the escalation,"" Sayyed Nasrallah pointed out, ""The Russian military achievements also allowed Moscow to cut the number of deployed troops.""  ""Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat of deploying troops within hours in Syria if necessary asserts that the Russian political stance has not changed.""  ""Hezbollah was notified about the partial withdrawal of the Russian troops from Syria before it occurred.""  Politically, Sayyed Nasrallah said that the all the parties of the axis of resistance aim at reaching a solution in Syria, adding that the Americans have become certain that terrorist groups can never change the battlefield situation.  ""The Americans have cancelled their programs to train the so-called moderate militants for they failed to fight ISIL and as the US realized that the terrorists would replace the Syrian government if it fell.""  ""The US administration wants to reach a political solution that serves its interests and those of its allies, not the Syrians.""  The axis of resistance aims at reaching a political settlement that preserves the Syrians' rights to determine the destiny of the ruling system, according to Sayyed Nasrallah.  ""We will not let the Americans and their allies obtain politically what they failed to get in the battlefield.""  Sayyed Nasrallah noted that the Turkish losses due to Syria developments are huge, which imposed on the Turks to be more realistic than the Saudis who are deactivating all the political solutions.    Saudi delays the political solution in Syria, betting on any possible change in"

Wiesel says the story is a true report of his life experience and that he has that number on his arm still today. Yet by refusing to show it to the public for the past 60 years, he is as good as admitting that he does not have it.  In courts of law, whenever a claimant fails to provide proof of his claim, he forfeits his right to that claim.  Wiesel has failed to provide proof that he has the tattoo so he must give up the claim. This is the clearest admission he could make, would you not agree? I mean, we’re not talking about a private area of his body that he would not want to expose, but only his left forearm.  Wiesel keeps his arm covered at all times in public and is never asked about it by the complicit media. However, on a few occasions he must have forgotten and did allow himself to be photographed with bare arms, so we do have a few photos of this part of his anatomy—but with no tattoo visible at all! When asked to comment on that fact, not only Mr. Wiesel, but Mrs. Wiesel, and all Wiesel’s friends and business and academic associates remain totally silent. Even Oprah Winfrey has said nothing about it. This is not a reasonable way to behave.  Now put together the above with the knowledge that Wiesel’s entire fabulous career, success and wealth (including the Nobel Peace Prize and other coveted awards) is dependent on his being Auschwitz prisoner A7713, and you easily see the crucial importance it has for him. There is no debate about it.  A7713 is essential to Wiesel’s life story and the prestige and book sales he enjoys today.  Even with all that at stake, he won’t show it to anyone.  This can only be interpreted as an admission that he doesn’t have it. And he knows it. He knows that he has admitted by default that he does not have that tattoo (and therefore is not who he says he is) but he obviously prefers not to say so. He will keep the charade going as long as he lives, which is not much longer.  At this point his admirers and supporters start coming up with harebrained reasons for why he doesn’t have it or why he doesn’t show it. Their “reasons” ignore known facts and common sense, and are easily knocked down. I look forward to receiving some in the comments, although defense for Elie doesn’t have much staying power. His supporters may be starting to realize that it is he who makes them look foolish because of his refusal to engage on the issue. Especially, he refused to engage with Miklos Grüner on the issue—Grüner whose registration and other documentation at Auschwitz is in perfect order and who actually has a tattoo to match.  It was a fateful day for Elie Wiesel when, just off his great triumph at the Nobel Prize ceremony in Oslo in 1986, he went to Stockholm to meet “fellow Buchenwald child survivor” Miklos Grüner on a television show.

It has paid enough reparations when the Israelis have paid none to the Palestinians, and never intend to. In Uri’s missive a few week’s ago he mentioned that some compensation would have to be paid, but from “foreign sources”. Some might think that was very Jewish of him.  Americans, both parties, have never uttered a word about it. Sure, AIPAC is all onboard, but these new ships have some of the firing tubes enlarged to carry cruise missiles. And the Zios have the mini-nuke warheads to put on them so one hit does the trick.  The last Dolphin tansfer was a hoot because the Israelis held up delivery, insisting on a deeper discount than they already agreed to. This was a show of power to the Zionists back home that their political leaders could make Germany kneel, and she did. Israelis get off on this stuff, and the Likuds have played the game well, and with the US, too… Jim W. Dean ]  _________________________  - First published … April 10, 2015 -  The German Federal Security Council has allowed the government to deliver another submarine to the Tel Aviv regime.  The German daily newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung reported on Friday that the government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel will export the fifth of six promised Dolphin-class submarines to Israel after the council expressed its consent.  The German company ThyssenKrupp had already delivered the fourth submarine to the Israeli regime in September 2014.  The deliveries have greatly infuriated many people in the European country as one third of the $530-million submarines contract between Berlin and Tel Aviv has been set to be covered by German taxpayers.  Merkel’s administration has also come under fire for providing Israel with Dolphin-class submarines because they are capable of being equipped with nuclear cruise missiles.  Meanwhile, a military expert warned Berlin of the consequences of the submarines delivery, saying that the vessels, when in the hands of the Israeli regime, will turn into a threat to the security of the region and the world.  “These are new batch of submarines that Israel is receiving which have a markedly increased capability on what they’d had previously in terms of range, covertness and ability to reach different parts of the world than they had previously been able to do,” Peter Roberts, an expert in sea power and naval weapons systems at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told Russia-based Sputnik news agency.  Under Germany’s Military Weapons Control Act and the Export Act, the country’s Federal Security Council must approve of any military deal between Berlin and foreign states.    read full article at source: http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/04...ery-to-israel/

And is culturally, historically, and in all ways different from Europe.  But it represents the closest thing to an ethno-state in the world; its main purpose is to preserve and protect its people.  So, Israel sorta represents a ""semi-safe"" starting point for a would-be European ethno-state to pattern itself after without prompting the UK and US to declare it a NAZI(registered trademark) state, since the rationale is that it is just patterning itself after Israel.    I believe that's a big reason why these movements are ""embracing"" Israel and political correctness; I'm sure a lot of folks in those pictures you posted breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the Israeli and rainbow flags because it meant their boss or neighbor couldn't accuse them of being a NAZI.             Originally Posted by Bev   The only reason PEGIDA and the EDL wave the Israel flag is to piss off the muslims.    I'm not so sure.

So they say that the immigrants (who happen to be mostly Muslim) are ""culturally/religiously incompatible"", because then they won't be branded as NAZIs.

Yeah, this is a huge problem, but Marine Le Pen for one is also very worried about these kind of entanglements, and very worried about the US, and is supportive of Putin as a counterbalance to US ambitions.  I like Golden Dawn, but I don't think a Western European nation could (currently) get away with that kind of government without being invaded by the UK and US.  And I don't think the masses would support it either; they would need to be reassured that they weren't actually NAZIs, hence the need for waving the Israeli/rainbow flag."

False	Banned	The Bobster	http://www.vdare.com/articles/funny-...whitey-s-fault  Funny Thing: Coming Or Going—Gentrifying Or Fleeing—It’s Always Whitey’s Fault! By Nicholas Stix on March 15, 2014 at 10:11pm   Spike Lee’s notorious February 25 lecture at Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute in honor of Black History Month., was an expletive-filled, overtly racial, hypocritical rant. During the supposed Q&A, Lee jettisoned the format and steamrolled the adoring liberal white attendees:                         It’s important to note that the New York Magazine editor who called Lee’s rant “amazing” was not being ironic. Liberal whites must always re-define racist black behavior as something positive, anodyne, or just misrepresented and misunderstood, probably by white racists.  Of course, Lee’s position would only make sense if he still lived in the Fort Greene neighborhood he’d grown up in. In fact, he fled it back in 2000, to live far away from blacks in a $32 million mansion on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. [“Spike Lee’s Upper East Side mansion hits market at $32 million,” by Matt Chaban, New York Daily News, February 2, 2014]  But while Lee insists upon his own right to enter elite white neighborhoods, he simultaneously claims that whites should be banned from so much as wearing a Larry Bird jersey in a “black” neighborhood. Lee’s definition of “respect” isn’t English, but the black street thug version: submission to threats of physical force.  What Lee advocates is Politically Correct asymmetrical apartheid—blacks can live anywhere, but they can also maintain (through force) segregated black neighborhoods. [“Spike Lee and other sentimental segregationists,” by Harry Siegel, New York Daily News, March 4, 2014]  What’s worse is that Lee’s hypocritical tribalism is in line with what our rulers have been imposing on us for 60 years. Government at all levels moves with ruthless fanaticism to destroy any neighborhoods that are “too white.” Even Republicans get in the act—like Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead strategizing to culturally enrich his largely white state with Somali “refugees.”  Those pushing these policies live far away from the consequences they create. Like Lee, they say “Diversity for thee, but not for me.”  None of the nine white Supreme Court justices of the unanimous Brown decision lived among integration/diversity. Nor did the committee that helped federal judge Arthur Garrity “integrate” Boston’s public schools via forced busing during the 1970s. [“Busing’s Boston Massacre,” Hoover Institution, November 1, 1998]  Diversity-hustling white journalists typically live in virtually black-free areas in places like Bethesda and Potomac, Maryland. The journalists and Catholic Church functionaries who denounced Frank Borzellieri all live in lily-white areas—in one case, the same neighborhood as American Renaissance’s Jared Taylor.    The justification for sweeping government action on desegregation, busing, anti-white racial preferences, and demographic change is what the U.S. Supreme Court called in Bakke the “compelling state interest” of diversity. But the very people who push it seem the most eager to forgo its blessings.  What holds the whole scheme together is simply white guilt. While it is fashionable to sneer at white-driven gentrification, other propagandists condemn “white flight” for supposedly causing high black crime rates and economic collapse.  For example, former crime reporter David Simon created the TV show The Wire, a supposedly realistic look at crime and policing in Baltimore. During a documentary promoting the show, Simon asserted that social scientists had proved that when a formerly white neighborhood reached six percent black, the whites all pulled up stakes and left, as if whites said, ‘We won’t tolerate this level of black neighbors.’ Simon gravely nodded, after stating his pseudo-fact, as if to say, ‘You see how racist whites are?’  The simple truth: whites are fleeing the black violence, not causing it.  A revealing look at how “diversity” destroys communities is the 1998 book Left Behind in Rosedale, by sociologist Scott Cummings. This mainstream, academic work covers the destruction of Fort Worth TX’s formerly white, crime-free, University Heights neighborhood.  It’s a familiar tale. Middle-class blacks moved in, used the now desegregated neighborhood as a stepping stone, and moved on. They were followed by the underclass, who imposed a reign of racial terror on the aging whites who didn’t flee. Atrocities included the rape and murder of elderly women, in one case through shoving a broom handle down a woman’s throat.  The Fort Worth PD failed to protect the whites, the MSM ignored their plight and—as Cummings recounts—his academic colleagues positively reveled in the whites’ suffering.  But the reaction of liberal whites is far different if it is whites themselves who are changing neighborhoods. Usually middle/upper-middle class whitea buy up properties cheaply in depressed areas, and improve and profit off them. These “gentrifiers” often start out in working-class white neighborhoods, such as Brooklyn’s Park Slope, but soon run out of white areas, and have no choice but to wade into black communities, like Manhattan’s Harlem, Brooklyn’s Fort Greene, various parts of Baltimore, and other dilapidated, black-run cities.  Many urban dwelling gentrifying whites are socially liberal—which leads to awkward encounters once they actually encounter “diversity.” Recently, a lesbian Baltimore gentrifier, Tracey Halvorsen, came out of the closet about the black-on-white racial violence, in a searing personal essay. [“Baltimore City, You’re Breaking My Heart,” Tracey Halvorsen, Medium, February 6, 2014] Halvorsen inspired other Baltimore gentrifiers to recount their own harrowing experiences with blacks. But she also received the predictably hysterical blowback about how black crime is actually her fault, because of “inequality.” [“Some or All Fears: ‘Breaking My Heart’ Post Sparks Debate,” City Paper, February 7, 2014]. Suitably chastened, Halvorsen swiftly bent the knee, condemned those who had shown her support, and leapt back into the closet, pulling the door tightly behind her.  Even a liberal female homosexual, if she’s white, can do no right. Whites are racist if they move out of black neighborhoods because of black crime – or even notice black crime at all. But they are also racist if they move into black neighborhoods.  It’s a long drop from “for ourselves and our posterity” to public policy driven by the insecurities of people like Spike Lee.  Integration and diversity was never about improving the lives of blacks. It is about destroying the communities of whites—and creating a dysfunctional, dependent wreck in the place of the historic American nation.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons.  A French Jewish woman was assaulted by three men in an apparent antisemitic attack in the Paris suburb Sarcelles last Wednesday, the Algemeiner has learned.  The three assailants were of African origin and shouted “Hitler did not finish his work” and “dirty race” while assaulting the woman, according to a French antisemitism watchdog.  The victim said she was attacked after the son of one of the assailants threw a ball in her direction. The three men approached the woman to retrieve the ball when they began attacking her, according to the report.  The victim filed a complaint with local police shortly after the assault.  Because the attack was so violent, it was recommended that the woman take a 15-day furlough from work to recuperate, said the National Bureau of Vigilance Against Antisemitism.  Sarcelles is noted for its large Jewish community, and some call it “Little Jerusalem,” according to French-Jewish news portal JSS News. Last summer, the authorities reported violent attacks against local synagogues and Jewish-owned businesses.  Recently, the Algemeiner reported another Paris antisemitic assault involving a 40-person mob on Boulevard Voltaire.  read full article at source: http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/05/15...nish-his-work/

(from the article, below)  A woman who was arrested for leaving her toddlers in a hot car compounded the crime by doing it for a second time while she attended court over the earlier charges, authorities in Virginia say.  Laquanda Newby, 25, is now charged with several more counts of neglect for leaving her children unattended while she attended court.  Along with the charges she incurred in May, Newby has been charged with an additional three counts of contributing to the delinquency or abuse of a child after police discovered the children in a car outside the Henrico County Courthouse on Monday.  Newby had already been hit with abuse charges for leaving her two toddlers, 6 and 1, unattended in a hot car on May 26.  This time, police determined that the children were left alone for at least an hour. Worse, the car windows were rolled all the way up and the doors locked. Temperatures had reached the low 90s on Monday, police noted.  “Had a citizen not alerted us to this, it’s a situation that would’ve turned out much differently,” Henrico Sheriff’s Capt. David Kinkle told CBS 6 in Richmond.  The woman was quickly booked in jail. Her bond was also denied.  The children were placed with their father.  http://www.breitbart.com/big-governm...-attend-court/

A report published this week in a French-language Lebanese newspaper claimed that former South Lebanon Army (SLA) commander Antoine Lahad, 88, had died in Paris, triggering controversy in Lebanon.  Many in Lebanon fumed at the reported intention to hold a funeral or memorial service in his birthplace, and thousands protested on social media. They called for a protest on Monday afternoon on the road leading to Beirut's international airport in hopes of preventing a burial in Lebanon.  Lahad commanded the SLA from 1984 until it disbanded in 2000, when the IDF left southern Lebanon. The SLA, born of Lebanon's lengthy civil war in 1976, fought the PLO and Hezbollah and received Israeli backing.  When the IDF withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, Lahad sought to join his wife and children in Paris, but was rejected by French authorities, and he moved to Israel. Five years ago, he managed to make Paris his residence.  The report of his death has caused tremors throughout social media in Lebanon. A Facebook page opposing his burial in Lebanon has seen over 6,000 members join. ""Because Lebanon is the land of the resistance and the martyrs and because the collaborator Antoine Lahad and his ilk were the bleeding wound of our families on the motherland,"" wrote one user.  http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7...700240,00.html  What a provocation after the Lebanese didn't fall for the ""We Stink!"" regime change/destabalisation event.

True	Doesn't suffer fools well	-JC	"Coming from a mainstream ""news"" source, the Baltimore Sun, this mercifully-short, assessment of the situation in the USA may be a surprise to some of you. However, anyone who has spent time in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Detroit, and quite few seemingly majority Black cities would not be surprised other than by how long it has taken to begin talking about this problem.  Given what I've read, what surprised me was the use of the term ""elites"" and ""white elites"" perhaps simply testing to see if that will work. That's why it didn't surprise me to learn that it was ""incorrectly attributed."" http://m.snopes.com/politics-soapbox-black-dilemma/  The Black Dilemma  Ian Duncan  The Baltimore Sun , May 30, 2015   For almost 150 years the United States has been conducting an interesting experiment. The subjects of the experiment: black people and working-class whites.   The hypothesis to be tested: Can a people taken from the jungles of Africa and forced into slavery be fully integrated as citizens in a majority white population?   The whites were descendants of Europeans who had created a majestic civilization. The former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements. Acting on a policy that was not fair to either group, the government released newly freed black people into a white society that saw them as inferiors. America has struggled with racial discord ever since.   Decade after decade the problems persisted but the experimenters never gave up. They insisted that if they could find the right formula the experiment would work, and concocted program after program to get the result they wanted. They created the Freedmans Bureau, passed civil rights laws, tried to build the Great Society, declared War on Poverty, ordered race preferences, built housing projects, and tried midnight basketball.   Their new laws intruded into peoples lives in ways that would have been otherwise unthinkable. They called in National Guard troops to enforce school integration. They outlawed freedom of association. Over the protests of parents, they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice-versa. They tried with money, special programs, relaxed standards, and endless hand wringing to close the achievement gap. To keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race. They hung up Orwellian public banners that commanded whites to Celebrate Diversity! and Say No to Racism. Nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment.   Some thought that what W.E.B. DuBois called the Talented Tenth would lead the way for black people. A group of elite, educated blacks would knock down doors of opportunity and show the world what blacks were capable of.  There is a Talented Tenth. They are the black Americans who have become entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and scientists. But ten percent is not enough. For the experiment to work, the ten percent has to be followed by a critical mass of people who can hold middle-class jobs and promote social stability. That is what is missing.  Through the years, too many black people continue to show an inability to function and prosper in a culture unsuited to them. Detroit is bankrupt, the south side of Chicago is a war zone, and the vast majority of black cities all over America are beset by degeneracy and violence. And blacks never take responsibility for their failures. Instead, they lash out in anger and resentment.   Across the generations and across the country, as we have seen in Detroit, Watts, Newark, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, and now Ferguson, rioting and looting are just one racial incident away. The white elite would tell us that this doesn't mean the experiment has failed. We just have to try harder. We need more money, more time, more understanding, more programs, and more opportunities.   But nothing changes no matter how much money is spent, no matter how many laws are passed, no matter how many black geniuses are portrayed on TV, and no matter who is president. Some argue its a problem of culture, as if culture creates peoples behavior instead of the other way around. Others blame white privilege.   But since 1965, when the elites opened Americas doors to the Third World, immigrants from Asia and India people who are not white, not rich, and not connected have quietly succeeded. While the children of these people are winning spelling bees and getting top scores on the SAT, black youths are committing half the country's violent crime, which includes viciously punching random white people on the street for the thrill of it that has nothing to do with poverty.   The experiment has failed. Not because of white culture, or white privilege, or white racism. The fundamental problem is that American black culture has evolved into an un-fixable and crime ridden mess. [Blacks] do not want to change their culture or society, and expect others to tolerate their violence and amoral behavior. They have become socially incompatible with other races by their own design, not because of the racism of others but by their own hatred of non-blacks.  Our leaders don't seem to understand just how tired their white subjects are with this experiment. *hey don't understand that white people aren't out to get black people; they are just exhausted with them. They are exhausted by the social pathologies, the violence, the endless complaints, and the blind racial solidarity, the bottomless pit of grievances, the excuses, and the reflexive animosity.   The elites explain everything with racism, and refuse to believe that white frustration could soon reach the boiling point.  You can't legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The government can't give to anybody anything that the government doesn't first take from somebody else. When half of the people get the idea that they don't have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation.  You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it."

Details are still emerging about the incident.  The racial makeup of the attackers has not yet been revealed, but it is most likely that they were Moslems.  It almost feels as if we are seeing some type of Islamic terror attack in some form every day throughout Europe.  So why should we assume this is any different?  Once again, these incidents would be reduced dramatically if the Islamic population was removed from Europe.  From BBC:  A priest has been killed in an attack by two armed men at his church near Rouen in northern France, police and French media have said.  The armed men entered the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray during Mass, taking the priest and four other people hostage, the interior ministry said.  French TV said shots had been heard after police arrived at the scene. Both hostage-takers are now dead.  The area has been cordoned off and police have told people to stay away.  French interior ministry spokesman, Pierre-Henri Brandet, said one of the hostages had been critically wounded.  He said the hostage-takers had been “neutralised” after coming out of the church. Police were now searching the church for explosives.  There is currently no Twitter feed listed because we were banned by the faggots at Twitter after around three weeks.

Prior to the September 23rd incident, he was never a threat.  Pay close attention to the details!  Some incidents were not reported until a few days after the incident, and the e-mail ""evidence"" contradict each other.  I am basically done with this issue.  You all are determined to frame Jared as a jew with no evidence, and look for any and all reasons to support your view to put 100% of the blame on him and refuse to take a look at what the police have done to turn a harmless bat shit crazy young man, into someone who all of a sudden wanted to start killing people.  Something happened!  Read Jared's MySpace comments, he was complaining of the police.    What I am saying is that the police knew that he was bat shit crazy, and instead of getting him the help that he needed, they turned it into a criminal investigation at the end of September, increasing their pressure on him, especially the second and third weeks of December, trying to get him to commit a crime so that they can put him in prison.  It blew up in their faces when Jared ended up committing something bigger, the shooting spree last week.  In time I will be proven right.  But from now until then, I am not going to waste any more time on this.    Because I am not a Jamie Kelso, everyone of you motherfuckers will nitpick every little detail against me.

False	Mechanic	StanSikorski	I made a large investment in various types and calibers over the last few years, always replacing what I used for practice and then some. So these engineered shortages haven't phased me except for the climbing price to replace what I've shot. And I believe I have plenty in case of 'emergency'. Foreseeing all this coming years ago helped in that. Lots of people don't purchase thinking the stuff is always going to be there when they need it or that it's going to go bad if they don't use it quickly enough. When stored correctly ammo can last for decades and then some. I have a 30 year old box of .32 that looks as good as the day it was manufactured.  My hording aside, the gubment seems to pull this action to create a shortage or the perception that one is going to happen due to their huge orders. What needs to happen is the ammo industry either needs to increase their ability to produce ammo, or put a cap on how much the gubment can purchase at a time. And as a private entity they could do that, but they like the gubments money too much even though there are more of us with guns than the gubment. Sure the gubment helps to create these shortages, but the ammo industry could do more to help the situation and profit as well.  My 2 cents.

Hence why Shia Muslim Hezbollah and Lebanese Christians are protecting one another against Israel and ISIS, while also using every means possible to prevent Sectarian violence often provoked by the Mossad or people on their payroll in the region.

1950854	2015-11-25 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	"(Breitbart)EXCLUSIVE: The Media Is Wrong, White Student Unions Are not ""Hoaxes"" Created by Racists"	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	The chaos that erupted across college campuses earlier this month escalated racial tensions among students to levels not seen since the 1950s and 60s, as radical activists sought to enforce a new orthodoxy of ‘white privilege’ across universities. The inevitable consequence — a newly-racialized American campus — is beginning to emerge.  In the space of a few days, Facebook pages for “White Student Unions” have sprung up on dozens of campuses across North America. The pages adopt the language of campus activists, promising a “safe space” for white students and condemning alleged anti-white racism on campus.  Mainstream media outlets have reported on them as hoaxes, the product of online trolls who don’t even attend the campuses they claim to represent. The Daily Beast blames “racist trolls” from 8chan, 4chan, and white supremacist site The Daily Stormer for “fabricating” the Facebook pages in order to further stoke racial tensions.  But this narrative is incorrect. In private interviews conducted with the creators of a number of these groups, Breitbart Tech has found that a number of the new “White Student Unions” are indeed the product of students on campus who are afraid to speak out publicly.  But these students aren’t white supremacists, or even white nationalists. In some cases, they are not even white. One of the anonymous student group founders we spoke to, who did not wish to be identified, was of South Asian descent. Another founder was Mexican-American. They are concerned by what they see as unchecked hostility towards their fellow white students.  Juan (real name omitted at his request), a Mexican-American student at UC Santa Cruz (UCSC), said he started his White Student Union page as a means to mock the “absurd nonsense of crybaby, race-obsessed college students, [by] using their tactics against them,” although Juan also added that he now thinks there might be a serious problem to tackle. “We’re coming to see that there might actually be some hostility to the thought that one might be proud of being of European descent.”  Rajesh (real name omitted at his request), a South Asian student who founded a White Student Union page page for the University of British Columbia (UBC), also expressed concern at what he saw as the increasingly unequal racial hierarchy emerging on campuses. “In the current ideological and cultural environment I, as a non-white, am lucky,” said Rajesh. “I have the right to be proud of my heritage, I am not made to feel ashamed of who I am and don’t need to constantly walk on eggshells in conversations for fear of being thought a racist.”  “I value whites. I’m culturally comfortable among whites. I’ve always grown up around whites. I enjoy the company of whites,” he stated.  Rajesh also claimed he was not the only minority concerned by the new racism: “I’ve been surprised by how many non-whites we’ve had approaching us.

CRIF, the umbrella group of French Jewish communities, complained to the ministry about the teacher earlier this week, according to a report Thursday in the group’s newsletter.  It did not name the female teacher in question but said she teaches at the prestigious Janson-de-Sailly school, a post high-school preparatory course, and that she invited the course’s students to follow her Facebook page.  The CRIF report was based on original reporting by the Le Canard Enchainé, a satirical weekly, which, alongside cartoons and satirical articles, also features investigative journalism items and news.  On the teacher’s Facebook page, she wrote, according to Le Canard Enchainé, against “the American Jewish lobby” that she said supports Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. She also wrote that French President Francois Hollande “is a Jew who benefited from his belonging to that community to ascend in politics and who now denies this,” pretending to have a Catholic father on Wikipedia. Hollande “is Jewish and denies it. Backpedaling will begin all over, now that it is less beneficial for Jewry,” the teacher also wrote, according to the CRIF newsletter.  On the Holocaust, she wrote: “The Shoah was designed and organized by Jews.”  read full article at source: http://www.jta.org/2016/07/29/news-o...-with-students

This was nothing but propaganda used against the Germans during and after the war. Even to this day, there are people who believe this lie despite the fact that Jewish researchers have even gone on record stating that there is no evidence any of this happened.  Now we have a story stating how someone from the Netherlands tried to auction off a bar of soap allegedly made of Jewish fat on eBay. This is an obvious farce. Just look at the picture of this supposed bar of soap. I don’t know how anyone could possibly believe that this was real. The eBay listing which has since been removed was an obvious joke.  Dutch prosecutors have blocked the sale of a bar of soap which its owners claimed was made from the fat of Jewish people murdered at a Nazi death camp.  The owner attempted to sell the soap on the internet auction site eBay for €199 (£143). But as soon as the item went live, moderators removed it from sale.  Rumours – apparently started by the British – that the Nazis were mass-producing soap using the bodies of concentration camp victims first surfaced in the middle of the war.  Here’s a video which includes additional articles stating conclusively that Germans did not turn Jews into soap. It also exposes a lying Jew promoting the stupid Holocaust hoax and soaping lies.  read full article at source: http://www.dailyslave.com/lol-bar-of...ction-on-ebay/

Now, up here, 200 miles north of Stl, it's not like that. Missouri is truly a border state, a mixed state. It feels a little of all points on the compass. On the whole, at least the northern half, is a midwestern state with a southern admixture.

Amin Yu, 53, of Orlando, Florida worked from 2002 until February 2014 to obtain systems and components used in marine submersible vehicles at the direction of her co-conspirators at Harbin Engineering University in China, according to the charges.   Yu was charged with 18 counts, including acting as an illegal agent for a foreign government, unlawful export and money laundering. Yu fraudulently and knowingly exported materials in violation of U.S. law, the indictment said.                     Harbin Engineering University conducts research and development for the Chinese government and military, according to the charging document.                     Yu was a citizen of China and a lawful permanent resident of the United States while obtaining parts from companies in the United States, Canada and Europe.  In an email entered as evidence, Yu said at least one of the devices she had obtained, an underwater acoustic locator, would be used on an underwater drone.                      The case underlines tensions between the United States and China over intellectual property rights. The FBI has said cases of economic espionage rose 53 percent in 2015, the majority of which involved Chinese nationals.   If convicted, Yu faces a maximum of 20 years in federal prison for each count of money laundering and a maximum of 10 years for acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government.  read full article at source: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-us...-idUSKCN0XI29V

A Most Unsettling Trend: Christians Rejoicing in ISIS  Charisma News is praising a video in which families of murdered Egyptian Christian Copts thank ISIS for making martyrs of their loved ones. In it, a smiling man named Beshir who just lost two brothers to ISIS chats with an audience and callers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?featur...&v=hIEqjMm7BOg      Beshir: ISIS gave us more than we asked… ISIS strengthened our faith… I thank ISIS because they didn’t cut the audio when they screamed declaring their faith. Believe me when I tell you that the people here are happy and congratulating one another. They are not in a state of grief but congratulating one another for having so many from our village die as martyrs.      Caller: Today I was having a chat with my mother asking her what she would do if she an ISIS member on the street… She said she would invite him home because he helped us enter the kingdom of heaven.      Beshir: How beautiful!      Caller: I asked her what will you do if you see those ISIS members passing on the street and I told you ‘That’s the man who slayed your son.’ She said “I will ask for God to open his eyes and ask him into our house because he helped us enter the kingdom of God!  Meanwhile in the U.S., Franklin Graham, son of iconic evangelist Billy Graham, is finding a massive response among American Christians with the announcement that ISIS has triggered biblical Armageddon and the triumph of Christianity. One of his Facebook posts on the matter has already received nearly 150,000 likes and over 40,000 shares:        ""The evil of ISIS really shouldn’t shock us — it is fully in keeping with their ultimate agenda of hastening a final apocalypse. God’s Word tells us that there will be a final battle one day, but it will result in the defeat of Satan and all those allied with him. One thing is for sure — one day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.""  Franklin’s statement reverberated throughout Christian media. Thousands of ecstatic replies on Graham’s Facebook page reveal that many Christians are thrilled by the drama brought by ISIS. Below you see them celebrating the apocalypse they believe ISIS is bringing them. The consistency of a few popular themes is striking; I’ve left in just some of the endless repetition to show the odd uniformity in rhetoric. Hundreds simply say “Hallelujah!” and “Amen!”  Thrilled and Excited Over a Great Battle to Come      Amen, we know the day would come and it’s here!!!     Amen!!! Praise God…thru Christ we have the victory! Our brothers, the Coptic Christians that were beheaded for their faith in Jesus, are now in the arms of Jesus in Heaven!     Amen, the second coming of Jesus is near. All Christians rejoice.     Yes, Rev. Graham, they are trying to accelerate the Apocalypse… although we know how the story ends… Amen.     Have been to Israel, have seen the valley in which this final battle will take place , true not vacant , beautiful fertile fields as far as the eyes can see… Awesome just awesome….     With each event that happens my mind thinks how close we are to the coming of the Lord… and hearing the trumpet sound, that its time to go home.     ISIS just doesn’t know they they are laying out the red carpet for my Jesus.     Amen and these are truly exciting times, to know that soon we shall behold his glory.     You are so right.

1941635	2015-11-09 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Israeli Kike Ambassador To UN Says Palestinian Claims Of Jewish Organ Harvesting Is Anti-Semitic	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	The Israeli kike ambassador to the United Nations is saying that Palestinian allegations of Jewish organ harvesting is “anti-Semitic.”  I fully agree with the statement from this honorable citizen of Kikeistan.  Criticism of Jews at anytime is by default “anti-Semitic.”  This is because Jews never do anything wrong.  Jews are the greatest group of people on the planet.  The world simply would not be able to function without them.  Even though Jews drop bombs on women and children for no specific purpose, it is clearly absurd to believe that they would harvest organs from dead Palestinians.  From Reuters:  The Israeli ambassador to the United Nations on Wednesday rejected Palestinian allegations that Israel had recently harvested organs from Palestinians its forces had killed, condemning the charges as anti-Semitic.  In a letter to British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, president of the U.N. Security Council this month, the chief Palestinian delegate at the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, described what he said was the alleged harvesting of body parts of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces.  “After returning the seized bodies of Palestinians killed by the occupying forces through October, and following medical examinations, it has been reported that the bodies were returned with missing corneas and other organs,” Mansour wrote Rycroft on Tuesday.  He added that this was confirmation of “past reports about organ harvesting.”  Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon responded on Wednesday with a letter to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon demanding that the U.N. chief condemn what he described as Mansour’s open anti-Semitism.  read full article at source: http://www.infostormer.com/israeli-k...-anti-semitic/

As known commonly, the 1% is 99% jews. So it won't be hard to realize when those rats start running.

Something has got to break eventually. I think it will be sooner than later.

1693584	2014-05-25 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Jews in the News	False	The Epitome of Evil	Karl Radl	Jews in the News  (Week Ending: 25/05/2014)  Part I   N.B. Links to the relevant sources are included in the original article here.  --------------------------------------------------  This week sees the return of a favourite among readers; and one that I have had no end of email asking me to start writing again, 'Jews in the News': where we take a serious look at the jewish news of the week with just a touch of irreverent humour.  By way of beginning on a high note: Jill Abramson; the jewish (former) 'Executive Editor' (whatever that is) of the New York Times, has been fired by her jewish bosses. It has turned into a right old cat-fight with Abramson immediately running to the papers (well she is a mud-racking hack: so what did they expect?) and accusing her bosses at the 'Paper of Record' of everything from bias to being misogynists.  Yep the evil ill-defined misogynist strikes again folks: it is barely a wonder that she hasn't called them 'anti-Semitic Nazis' as well.  I mean come on Jill accusing your former employers of misogyny for sacking you is so twentieth century!  Get with the program: at least be a bit creative with your insinuations and accusations.  In related news: the 'pioneering editor' (who just happens to have also been jewish) of the New York Times from the 1970s and 1980s (when the sheet was at its worst if you ask me) Arthur Gelb has finally stopped dodging the welcoming embrace of his coffin and gotten into it.  Thank god for small mercies: at least now the devil can stop giving John Hagee excessive flatulence and get on with forcing Gelb to eat the intestines of pigs for a few centuries or so.  In Belgium two Israelis and a French woman have been shot and killed outside a jewish museum. Immediately Bibi Netanyahu (the world famous jewish yodeling champion) seems to know precisely what motivated the shooting: anti-Semitism. More specifically however... he knows that it was because of 'recent incitement against the jews' in Europe.  My my... isn't he telepathic?  That said Bibi is a bit of a broken record. Remember that the Israelis immediately blamed Iran for the recent disappearance of flight MH 370?  Probably not, but it goes to show that when any world event is concerned: the jews always blame their enemies as being the ones behind it sans evidence (incidentally Bibi said exactly the same thing about Palestinians earlier in the week). Since more reasonable and less knee-jerk commentary has come out: we have been told that there is no actual evidence that this shooting was 'anti-Semitic' at all.  This tide of rhetoric and histrionics from the jewish community is partly in response to the recent Anti-Defamation League 'survey' that claimed that a quarter of the world was anti-Semitic. The methodology was shoddy and the claims lackluster at best, but it has certainly got all the Shabbos goyim talking and 'demanding action' (although even local ADL operatives are struggling to explain the relevance of the survey to those who ask them awkward questions).  The Israel-Firster Front Page Magazine believes that a new 'holocaust' is just about to happen, while jewish groups are desperate to 'reintroduce the taboo on anti-Semitism' in Hungary. The jewish response to Hungarian indifference has been to hold another exhibition in fake guilt on the '70th Anniversary of the Holocaust in Hungary'... in the United States.  Oh that's really going to capture 'hearts and minds' now isn't it?  Further to all this jews are in hysterics over 'anti-Semitism in the Ukraine' (translated from jew-speak: jews being held accountable for their actions), a waiter has been banned from entering a whole geographic area for shouting 'Heil Hitler' at; and giving the Nazi salute to, jews in a kosher restaurant celebrating holocaust memorial day in the United Kingdom, the rapper Macklemore has appeared on stage wearing a stereotypical costume of a shtetl jew (unfortunately he has since apologized after the Anti-Defamation League frothed at the mouth and threatened to cut short his musical career) and a spate of 'anti-Semitic tweets' accompanied the defeat of Spain by Israel in basketball (with Spanish jews now demanding all those expressing their thoughts be hunted down and imprisoned for insulting the masters of the universe).  All this 'anti-Semitic' activity has been greeted with hilarious claims that anti-Semitism is a 'perversion' and a 'poison', but perhaps the most amusing thing of all is that jews are now claiming (like this little charmer at De Paul University) that other people holding anti-Zionist beliefs means that they feel physically threatened (despite the fact it was revealed this week how the Israel Lobby bribes university administrators).  Of course this alarmist nonsense (that jews have been screaming these sorts of things since at least the 1950s) occurs just as Martin Schulz; President of European Parliament, has been sucking up to jews again and begging to inform them that he'd never allow a boycott of Israel (although Europe has this week enacted a ban on poultry from illegal Israeli settlements).  What is causing jews to grab megaphones and scream 'Oy Vey!' is the rise and rise of nationalist parties in Europe that the jews seem completely unable and at a loss to stop (the Israeli embassies are even getting involved to co-ordinate activism): even the brutally and illegally suppressed patriotic Golden Dawn party in Greece is still polling very well and causing jews to accuse Greece of being the most 'anti-Semitic country in Europe'.  After all when the ardently philo-Semitic French media are accused of 'fueling anti-Semitism' you know the jews are getting desperate and running out of excuses/things to claim.  I mean calling John Kerry 'anti-Semitic' when his wife; Teresa Heinz Kerry, is well-known to be a jewess is simply lame, which is once again a sign of jewish desperation. They can see the tide is turning and they know that they have pushed the people of the world so extraordinarily far this time that they cannot even contemplate the consequences without gibbering to themselves in a dark room.  This ray of hope to patriots everywhere is confirmed by a jew-wise Russian fashion designer who is back in business much to the chagrin of international jewry.  Leaving the world of anti-Semitism now: we move to Israel and first up is the fact that Canada is considering removing the right of jews to be joint Israel-Canadian citizens, which is a step in the right direction, but it has jews frothing at the mount and declaiming loudly about 'the return of Nazism' to Canada.  Also the former jewish terrorist Shimon Peres (well he is still a jewish terrorist: just a state-approved one now) is stepping down from the Presidency of Israel and the race is very much on to replace him.  Watch this space for flying fedoras, raucous rabbis, jew-on-jew slapfests, jews getting accused of not having enough jewish ancestry and the exposure of a tonne of corruption inside the Israeli establishment.  Oh what glorious fun we shall have!  While in related Israeli politics this week: it has emerged that Bibi Netanyahu was ready to sack Tzipi Livni just for meeting Mahmoud Abbas (the head of the Palestinian government) and not treating him as a dirty little goy who needs to be dictated too while a jewish boot presses his face into the mud.  This is hardly surprising given that it is Netanyahu's policy to push the West Bank into a state of economic collapse and which is succeeding while being ignored due to the influence of Israel's amen corner worldwide. That said with Israel's latest defense budget having gone through the Knesset: a senior Israeli economist is predicting the collapse of Israel's economy as it is simply cannot stand the load.  This might be why the Israel Lobby in the United States has been so focused on getting the US government to double its funding for the controversial 'Iron Dome' project (the US taxpayers pay for it, while Israel gets it free of charge just because... well it is Israel and has loyal members of the tribe up at the very top of the United States government).

Almost 500 people on job seeker’s allowance have been told to report for duty as labourers or face having their dole money stopped as Hungary races to complete the fence by the end of the month.  The Hungarian plan for the 108-mile barrier has provoked sharp international criticism with some labelling it a new Iron Curtain in Europe. But the Hungarian government has defended its decision, saying the wall is needed to curb the growing number of migrants targeting the Schengen-zone country as a gateway into the EU.  Last month Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, described illegal immigrants coming from the “depths of Africa” as a threat to Europe’s existence.

The cemetery is the final resting place for an SS second lieutenant who died in 1941, Gisbert Katzwendel, and a clerical worker for the Nazi party, Friedrich Katzwendel. The SS lightning bolts proudly worn by the elite Nazi troops are carved into their tombstones.  Under an Austrian law enacted in 1947, Nazi regalia and symbols may not be publicly displayed. In the past it has been argued that the law need not apply to depictions created before 1947 - such as tombstone carvings.  Uwe Sailer told the Kurier newspaper that he has to pass the graves in question when he goes to visit his father-in-law’s grave, and is filled with disgust every time he sees them.  ""It's disgusting and a nuisance that this is on public display,"" Sailer said. “For a long time I’ve been hoping that this insignia would be removed but nothing has happened,” he complained. He finally contacted the Upper Austrian network against right-wing extremism.  The organisation’s spokesman, Robert Eiter, said he was outraged. “These runes are Nazi symbols and therefore forbidden by law”. He added that it was “incomprehensible that the grave owners had not had them removed - and the cemetery administration should not have ignored this. We’re now demanding that they be removed as soon as possible,” he said.  Karin Weilguny, head of the cemeteries and burials department in Linz, told the Kurier that the city’s legal team has written to the owner of the plot, requesting that the banned symbols be removed by no later than July 27th. She said it was the first she had heard of the Nazi symbols. “This isn’t something we approve of and therefore we’re happy to have been tipped off”.  She added that she regretted that the runes went unnoticed when ashes were last interred in the family plot in 2010. “Our staff have now been instructed to keep an eye out for such a thing in the future.” She said that if the grave owner failed to do anything by the deadline, city officials would remove the symbols themselves and send the owner the bill.  Last year the owner of a cemetery plot in Graz was ordered to cover up a swastika on a grave dating from 1934, or pay a €4,000 fine.  At the time some people argued that the swastika should be allowed to remain in cemeteries as a ""political and societal symbol"" of the era.

A day after the United Nations Security Council adopted the pact amid recriminations from senior Iranian hard-liners, Gen. Mohammad Reza Naqdi claimed Washington was using the accord as pretext for a future US military strike against Iran.  “Any Iranian who reads the Vienna documents will hate the US 100 times more [than before],” Naqdi said Tuesday according to the semi-official Fars News Agency.  “The US needs the agreement merely to legalize the sanctions and continue pressure against Iran,” he added.  The remarks by Naqdi, a commander of the volunteer Basij forces, came one day after the UN Security Council unanimously voted to endorse the deal paving the way to lift crippling international sanctions in exchange for curbs on nuclear enrichment.  Naqdi denounced the language used in Resolution 2231 as inflammatory and hostile toward Iran.  “All paragraphs of the resolution that the US proposed to the UNSC are full of enmity towards Iran and show the US deep grudge against the Iranian nation,” he charged.  On Monday, another senior Iranian general expressed his opposition to the deal, saying the pact was unacceptable.  Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps told the Iranian news agency Tasnim that “Some parts of the draft have clearly crossed the Islamic Republic’s red lines, especially in Iran’s military capabilities. We will never accept it.”  After the Security Council endorsed the agreement, Tehran claimed its ballistic missile program was not subject to the UN resolution that officially  The historic agreement with Tehran was reached last Tuesday in Vienna by the UN council’s five permanent members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States plus Germany.  Iran says it has built ballistic missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles), capable of striking its longtime enemy Israel.  The agreement calls on Iran to slash its enrichment activity by two-thirds and open up its nuclear facilities to inspections, including military sites.  read full article at source: http://theuglytruth.wordpress.com/20...xt-for-attack/

He appeared in court this Wednesday at Coutances for a video which called into question the extermination of the European Jews.  11/02/2015  During the court session this Wednesday afternoon at the tribunal of Coutances, the accused said that he did not want ""to transform the court into a platform."" The man nonetheless then unrolled the classic argumentation of the denier, invoking [the right to] liberty of expression and lambasting the Gayssot Act, ""unconstitutional"" according to him, which first instituted the offense of contesting the existence of crimes against humanity. At the bar, the former mathematics teacher, who was previously condemned in 2007 for similar actions, expressed his convictions without any beating around the bush, affirming himself to be a follower of the ideology of National Socialism.  At the heart of the trial this Wednesday: a video posted on the Internet which calls into question the extermination of the Jews of Europe and denounces the participation of youth from Lower Normandy in educational voyages to Auschwitz, voyages which form, according to him, a ""brainwashing in the name of 'duty to remember.'"" In the film of 45 minutes, hosted on an extreme right-wing website, the author attacks two memorial associations and uses images of youth from the region participating in commemorations.  While the defence of the accused aroused no surprise, the judgment delivered by the tribunal did not fail to make an impression. Vincent Reynouard was condemned to two years in prison, non-suspended, which is double the amount which had been requested [by the prosecutors] and double the usual punishment for this kind of crime (1 year of prison). The prosecutor, judging this punishment to be excessive, called for an appeal. There thus will be a second trial at the Court of Appeals at Caen.  The former mathematics teacher, soon to be 46 years of age, was also ordered to pay 3500 euros to LICRA (International League Against Racism and Anti-semitism) as well as 500 euros to the associations ""D-Day Overlord"" and ""Westlake Brothers Souvenir."" This latter organization plans to pass this money along to an English veteran to help finance his medical care. Finally, Vincent Reynouard must pay a symbolic euro to the community of communes [municipal federation] of Trévières.  Source:https://forum.codoh.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=9267   Add:  His computer hardware was seized, he will also have to pay the publication of the sentence in five national daily newspapers and regional.  "" We are very satisfied with the condemnation of this maniac of the Nazism "", declared Christophe Collet, president of the association Westlake Brothers Souvenir ( WBS ), who promotes the memory of the liberators, in particular Canadian, and who appears in the video.

I don’t really know what else to say about this. I suppose there isn’t much to say until more information is available.  An attacker who witnesses said shouted “Britain First” shot and stabbed a member of British Parliament Thursday near Leeds, killing her, police confirmed.  Officers arrested an unnamed 52-year-old man in connection with the attack and recovered weapons, saying they were not seeking any other possible suspects. “Britain First” is a slogan commonly used by activists who support Britain leaving the European Union.  The lawmaker was identified as 41-year-old Jo Cox, a member of the Labor Party representing Batley, and a mother of two.  “Somebody tried to grab [the attacker], wrestling with him and then he wielded a knife, like a hunting knife, just started lunging at her with a knife half a dozen times,” Clarke Rothwell, the owner of a nearby cafe in Birstall, told the BBC.  “He was stabbing her with a footlong knife multiple times while shouting Britain First, Britain First, Britain First,” Rothwell told The Telegraph.  Investigators described the attack as a “localized incident.”  No serving U.K. member of Parliament has been killed since 1990, when the Irish Republican Army killed Conservative lawmaker Ian Gow with a booby-trap bomb placed under his car outside his English home.  “We were extremely shocked to see these reports,” Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of the Britain First movement, told The Guardian, saying Britain First would not condone that behavior. Britain’s Vote Leave and Vote Remain groups suspended campaigning after the attack.  The suspect ultimately kicked the lawmaker on the ground and walked off “very coolly, very slowly,” leaving her bleeding between two cars, witness Hithem Ben Abdallah told Sky News. “A very courageous man from the dry cleaners tried to restrain him and he couldn’t stop him because all of a sudden he pulled a gun. She was a standing still target for him when he shot her.”  Police did not reveal details on a possible motive. Cox wrote an editorial last week for the Yorkshire Post opposing the so-called “Brexit,” ahead of the referendum vote scheduled for June 23.  She also has made finding a solution to the Syrian civil war a top priority and has been critical of Britain’s reluctance to deepen its military involvement against Islamic State terrorists as part of that effort.  read full article at source: http://www.dailystormer.com/uk-pro-e...xit-supporter/

1779968	2015-01-05 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Indian Government Sending Out Inspectors to Verify That People are Using Toilets	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	DailyStormer.com  India has a problem with people taking dumps in the open which has resulted in a major sanitation issue for the country. Many Indians believe that defecating in the open is preferable to using a toilet. This has obviously created a number of problems.  As a result of this, the Indian government is now sending out inspectors to make sure that people are using toilets.  So even though the Indians are still trying to solve the problem of open defecation, the Indians as a society are no different than us White people according to the Jew run media. That’s comical when you consider this story.  City Lab:  India has a lot more to overcome than just a mass installation of toilets and latrines. In a recent survey of 3,200 rural households by Delhi-based Research Institute for Compassionate Economics, half of respondents who didn’t have a toilet believed that “defecating in the open is the same or better for health than using a latrine.” Most people who owned a government-constructed latrine still chose to use the outdoors. Some end up using their loo for storage or extra living space.  Modi’s administration announced Wednesday that sanitary inspectors will soon be going door-to-door to “check and verify the use of toilets,” using tablets or phones to publish results online in “real time,” according to a press release. “Earlier, the monitoring was done only about the construction of toilets, but now the actual use of toilets will be ascertained.”  All races are exactly the same so it is their culture that makes them want to poop outside, even when toilets are available. Oh but don’t you dare question their culture, goyim – all cultures are exactly the same in value. In fact, now that I think about it, I am pretty sure the Indian government is racist against itself for telling these colorful people not to crap outside.

True	News Bot	VanguardNewsNetwork	“He goes so far as to argue that Nazism, while containing elements of fascism, is not entitled to be regarded—as it always is regarded—as a species of fascism proper, much less as the quintessential expression of fascism.”  Hitler said that Nazism was not Fascism. He probably said that because Mussolini’s fascism wasn’t racial, while Nazism was. Anyway, as someone once pointed out, fascism assumes different forms in different countries. Sometimes it even has more than one leader (e.g., the 3-man military junta that ruled Argentina circa 1978). Sometimes it’s even Christian (e.g., Spain under Franco). To my mind, fascism is right-wing socialism run by a dictator(s). That describes a lot of countries, including Hitler’s Germany, Italy under Mussolini, Portugal under Salazar, Spain under Franco, Vichy France under Petain, Cuba under Batista, Chile under Pinochet, etc.   [Article].

Citizenship drive organizers in California say they’ve seen a huge spike in interest from people who want to become citizens.  Nearly one million people are expected to apply for naturalization in 2016, according to The New York Times. That’s about 200,000 more people than average in recent years.

Apparently Graham asked The Donald for some favors a few years back which is why he had his phone number. The number is 1-202-228-0292 if you’d like to try it lol.  Trump is successfully trolling the entire political establishment and it is not only funny, but it is forcing the media and politicians to deal with real issues.  And for the record I think Lindsey Graham should apologize for pretending as though he is a heterosexual man. Just one look at him and it is clear that he likes da poo poo.  From CBS:  If Linsdey Graham thought he could shame Donald Trump into backing down from his rhetoric, he apparently thought wrong.  “Run for president, but stop being the world’s biggest jackass,” the South Carolina senator told “CBS This Morning.”  Trump fired back during a campaign rally in Graham’s home state, telling a South Carolina audience that Graham is a “stiff” who could never get a job in the private sector.  Trump then told a story about Graham calling him 4 years ago for a campaign endorsement and contribution. Trump claimed he went back through his phone records and found Graham’s private cell phone number. He showed the audience the number, written down on a yellow post-it note, and read the number aloud, encouraging everyone “let’s try it.”  CBS News has confirmed the number does belong to Senator Graham. When CBSDC called the number, it went straight to voice mail, with a follow-up message that the mailbox is full.  read full article at source: http://www.dailyslave.com/the-donald...indsey-graham/

The cartoon depicts Alan's body alongside a caption suggesting he would have become a ""groper in Germany"".  It follows the revelation that gangs of migrants carried out organised sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve.  The magazine has been widely condemned on social media and accused of racism.  Twitter users called the image ""disgusting"" and ""tasteless"", as well as accusing the magazine of racism and Islamophobia.  The controversial cartoon comes a week after the anniversary of the shooting at the magazine, which killed 10 of its staff.  Alan Kurdi has become a touchstone for the magazine's satirists, appearing in a number of cartoons over the past few months.  One, which was rejected as a cover image, showed the boy's body washed up on the beach next to a McDonald's advert, with the caption, ""So close"".   This latest use of his image seems to be an attempt to satirise those who would blame all migrants and refugees in Germany for the actions of a few, some Twitter users suggested.   The attacks in Cologne have heightened existing tensions in Germany over the country's open policy towards migrants and refugees.   But a series of highly provocative cartoons have cooled the extraordinary outpouring of solidarity with the magazine after the January 2015 attacks.  It has been beset by infighting and its senior cartoonist Luz - the man who designed the first edition after the attack - announced his resignation.  read full article at source: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35306906"

1942527	2015-11-11 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	European Union Moves to Label Products From Israeli Settlements	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	LONDON — The European Union pushed ahead on Wednesday with rules for labeling consumer goods from Jewish-owned businesses and farms in the land Israel captured during the 1967 war, creating new strains in relations between Europe and Israel.  European officials played down the move, saying the guidelines merely clarified existing rules, but Israeli leaders condemned it as provocative, discriminatory and intended to fuel a growing international movement to boycott the country.  The issue has been percolating for years, and Israel has lobbied hard against the labeling requirements. The European Union’s decision to go ahead came against the backdrop of several European countries formally or symbolically recognizing a Palestinian state, actions that have prompted deep unease in Israel.  The European Union is Israel’s top trading partner, with total commerce estimated at 30 billion euros, or $32 billion, last year: €13 billion in imports from Israel and €17 billion in exports to Israel. There are no official European statistics on imports of goods from Israeli settlements, but such goods are believed to represent less than 1 percent of the total trade. And the new guidelines are only mandatory for some goods, mostly fruits and vegetables, so while stinging, they are largely symbolic.  “This is no way changes our stance with respect to the Middle East peace process,” a spokesman for the European Commission said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic. “This in no way affects the agreement we have with Israel with respect to preferential treatment for their products sold in the European Union. All ‘Made in Israel’ products will continue to come into the European Union with very low, or no, tariffs. What will also not change is that products coming from the settlements cannot benefit from those preferences.”  The spokesman added that the European Commission was acting at the behest of member governments and to reconcile conflicting advice. European Union members — Britain in 2009, Denmark in 2013 and Belgium in 2014 — had begun issuing their own guidelines for labeling consumer products from the land outside Israel’s original borders.  But Emmanuel Nahshon, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, condemned the move as “an exceptional and discriminatory step,” especially “when Israel is confronting a wave of terrorism targeting any and all of its citizens.” Israel summoned the European Union’s ambassador to Israel, Lars Faaborg-Andersen, for a meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem.  “It is puzzling and even irritating that the E.U. chooses to apply a double standard concerning Israel, while ignoring that there are over 200 other territorial disputes worldwide, including those occurring within the E.U. or on its doorstep,” Mr. Nahshon said in a statement. “The claim that this is a technical matter is cynical and baseless.”  The guidelines state that the term “product of Israel” should not be  ----- snip -----   read full article at source: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/wo...ents.html?_r=0

In an interview with Vogue magazine published last week, the daughter of business mogul Donald Trump revealed that she and her husband, Jared Kushner, keep Shabbat, including not using their telephones on the day of rest.                      “We observe the Sabbath,” Trump said. “From Friday to Saturday we don’t do anything but hang out with one another. We don’t make phone calls.”  The subject of her conversion, which Trump, 33, admits she has preferred to keep out of the public eye, came up during a meeting with reporter Jonathan Van Meter in the Trump SoHo hotel. As waiters brought over food, Trump noted, “We don’t eat meat… or, well, we keep kosher.”  The mother of two then went on to speak more about life after her 2009 conversion, a move she made because husband Kushner’s family are Orthodox Jews, but has since been kept discreet. Trump’s father, Donald, is a Presbyterian Christian.  “I just feel like it’s such an intimate thing for us,” said Trump, who is reported to have taken the moniker “Yael,” a popular Jewish women’s name. Yael was an Old Testament woman who, according to the story from Judges 5:24-27, killed enemy general Sisera by driving a tent peg though his head, enabling the Israelites to gain victory in a war.  “We’re pretty observant, more than some, less than others,” Trump explained. “It’s been such a great life decision for me. I am very modern, but I’m also a very traditional person, and I think that’s an interesting juxtaposition in how I was raised as well. I really find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity.”  In addition to her executive position in The Trump Organization, she was also a successful model and has her own line of fashion shoes and handbags.  read full article at source: http://www.timesofisrael.com/ivanka-...-to-be-jewish/

Although the euroskeptic UKIP leader has publicly claimed he hopes to create a “peoples party” independent of corporatism, he privately encouraged his party affiliates to forge relationships with influential City tycoons.  Documents reveal, while addressing the party’s executive committee in 2012, Farage said “the key to money for us will be the hedge fund industry.”  He also referenced a meeting with a Swiss billionaire businessman, while encouraging UKIP members to capitalize on the party’s improved position in the polls and reach out to leading financiers.  The controversial statements came to the public’s attention following the disclosure of an internal party report dated September 3, 2012.  The leaked document undercuts arguments espoused by UKIP members who claim the Conservative Party relies on the City of London as underwriters.  It documents Farage as telling UKIP’s executive committee: “We are very close to the tipping point of being able to do something very, very big.”  “The type of people we are talking to has changed. People who would have slammed the door in our face three years ago are inviting us. The key to money for us will be the hedge fund industry.”  Since 2012, UKIP has secured the support of many gilded donors from the City of London.  One noteworthy financier is Andy Brough, a leading fund manager at global asset management company Schroders. The firm manages £276.2 billion for institutional and retail investors across the globe.  Brough joined UKIP’s ranks when his dissatisfaction with the coalition government and Europe’s regulatory jabs at the City of London reached a tipping point.    Another hedge fund tycoon that backs Farage’s party is Crispin Odey, who runs Odey Asset Management. The investment mogul famously awarded himself a handsome £28 million in 2008, despite an unstable financial climate at the time that culminated in a crippling credit crunch.  The prominent investor’s former father-in-law is the world’s most prominent TV and newspaper baron, Rupert Murdoch.  While Odey is not an explicit member of UKIP, he reportedly hosted a fete in early 2014 in what appeared to be an effort to introduce Farage to possible donors and supporters.  A co-founder of a leading hedge fund, Jo Hambro, offered UKIP a sizeable £50,000 donation last year. The investment mogul, whose £200 million portfolio of assets landed him in the Sunday Times Rich list, previously donated to David Cameron’s Conservative Party.  Despite UKIP’s efforts to gain the support of influential City of London financiers, the Conservatives remain the primary benefactors of hedge fund firms and their proprietors.  UKIP’s finances have grown markedly over the past two years, however.  For the first time in electoral history, the euroskeptic party outspent Ed Miliband’s Labour Party in last May’s national council elections.  UKIP also spent almost three times as much as Labour in the 2014 European election, and now stands as Britain’s biggest party on the EU stage with 24 representatives in Brussels.  UKIP insiders say the party’s finances are robust in the run-up to May’s general election, according to The Guardian.  UKIP declined to comment on the leaked report. A party spokeswoman said it was not policy to discuss internal documents that had been leaked to the public.  http://rt.com/uk/219399-ukip-hedge-funds-future/

Protesters have been marching holding their fists up to represent the black power symbol, but why should race mean anything at all? Police actually kill more white people than black, so why are black lives the only lives worth focusing on? Everyone knows that if a white person held a sign saying “White Lives Matter’, they would be called a racist. That is exactly what is happening in a town in Connecticut. Police are investigating why hundreds of fliers are showing up around town that read “#WHITE LIVES MATTER”.  The fliers are being called racially charged and call for all white people to stand up for their race. They read:  Our lives matter too. The media will not report it so we will remind you: Stand up for the white race! As we have seen in the recent riots, we only have each other to count on. It’s time to wake up and realize what is really going on. We need to stop accepting it, our lives matter too. Stop being silent, speak out, it is still your right to do so.   A spokesperson for Milford police said the department has fielded several calls from concerned residents. The right to free speech protects such language, but officers said a city ordinance prohibiting the distribution of fliers may be enforceable.  http://xtribune.com/2015/05/hundreds...white-people/#

Planted in charred earth, the oil palm saplings were identified near the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Sanctuary in central Kalimantan, by Greenpeace Indonesia.   According to public maps, no oil palm concession has been granted in the area.   During a dry season exacerbated by El Ni&ntilde;o, thousands of fires have ripped through Indonesian forests in Sumatra and Kalimantan over recent months, sparking a region-wide haze crisis and releasing alarming levels of carbon emissions.   With half of the hotspots on carbon-rich peatland, over the past month carbon emissions from the fires have surpassed the average daily emissions of the entire US economy.  Predominately lit by smallholder farmers who use slash and burn techniques to clear the land – the fires are the fastest and cheapest way to clear land for new plantations.   In the wake of the destruction, environmentalists are calling on the forest areas to be fully restored and for the palm oil industry’s role in the fires to be thoroughly examined.  Under the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) made in September 2014, major producers that operate in Indonesia, the world’s largest producer of palm oil, commited to sustainable palm oil practices and zero-deforestation.   The signatories to IPOP – Wilmar, Asian Agri, Cargill, GAR and Musim Mas– account for 80% of the palm oil industry in Indonesia.  To live up to their commitments, conservation scientist Eric Meijaard says these leading producers have to address the fire crisis in a tangible way.  “With these fires all the burn scars need to be mapped and any oil that is subsequently grown on these burnt lands should just stay out of the responsible market,” Meijaard told the Guardian, “They have to somehow develop the tracing systems that allow them to confidently say that none of this came from lands that were burned in 2015.”  But in the complicated web that forms the Indonesian palm oil sector, palm oil giants operate their own plantations and mills, but also source a sizeable amount of oil palm from independent smallholders, in some cases up to 40%.  The problem is that, with brokers and middlemen and an estimated 4 million smallholder farmers, fresh bunches of oil palm fruit might change hands several times before reaching the mill.  While on paper the IPOP commitments extend to third-party suppliers, including the smallholder farmers blamed for lighting the fires, in reality opaque supply chains mean palm oil producers don’t always know who all of their suppliers are, nor what practices they are engaged in.  It makes for a complicated accountability trail, says Tomoyuki Uno, Asia manager of the UN Development Programme’s green commodities programme.  “Palm oil might be coming from the national parks but as long as you don’t know about it, or they are three or four different supply chains removed from you, you might not be implicated,” he says.  More official supply chains, he argued, will facilitate better protection of forests as well as better governance and productivity.  In the past week rains have helped to dampen the hotspots and lift the toxic haze, but the fires are an annual problem in Indonesia and this year they are among the worst on record.  read full article at source: http://www.theguardian.com/environme...d-in-indonesia

The speech by Tzipi Hotovely illustrated the influence of hardliners in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new government, and the challenges he will face as he tries to persuade the world that he is serious about pursuing peace with the Palestinians.  Hotovely, 36, is among a generation of young hard-liners in Netanyahu's Likud Party who support West Bank settlement construction and oppose ceding captured land to the Palestinians. Since Netanyahu has a slim one-seat majority in parliament, these lawmakers could complicate any attempt to revive peace talks.  With Netanyahu also serving as the acting foreign minister, Hotovely is currently the country's top full-time diplomat.  In an inaugural address to Israeli diplomats, Hotovely said Israel has tried too hard to appease the world and must stand up for itself.  ""We need to return to the basic truth of our rights to this country,"" she said. ""This land is ours. All of it is ours. We did not come here to apologize for that.""  Hotovely, an Orthodox Jew, laced her speech with biblical commentaries in which God promised the Land of Israel to the Jews. Speaking later in English, she signaled that she would try to rally global recognition for West Bank settlements, which are widely opposed.  ""We expect as a matter of principle of the international community to recognize Israel's right to build homes for Jews in their homeland, everywhere,"" she said.  Hotovely will manage the ministry's day-to-day functions, but Netanyahu will remain in charge of foreign policy.  During the recent election campaign, Netanyahu angered his Western allies by saying that he would not permit the establishment of a Palestinian state on his watch. On Wednesday, he told the visiting EU foreign policy chief that he remains committed to a two-state solution.  Netanyahu's spokesman, Mark Regev, declined comment on Hotovely's speech, but said Netanyahu's statements Wednesday reflected his policy.  read full article at source: http://news.yahoo.com/senior-israeli...164218215.html"

Perm-36 museum director Viktor Shmyrov said the ""memorial won't disappear, but the museum has been taken over by other people appointed by the new authorities, who have totally changed the content,"" BBC Russian Service reported Wednesday.  ""Now it's a museum about the camp system, but not about political prisoners. They don't talk about the repressions or about Stalin,"" he was quoted as saying.  Arseny Roginsky, president of Russia's leading human rights group Memorial — which founded the museum two decades ago — said the new management included former prison camp guards, AFP reported.  ""The museum's format is being completely changed,"" Roginsky was quoted as saying. ""It's tragic that a museum to Soviet terror will be transformed into a museum to the penal system.""  The takeover of Perm-36, which is located in the Perm region, comes as an increasing number of Russians express favorable views of Stalin and amid the government's glorification of its Soviet past.  Perm-36 — the only museum in Russia created on the site of a former gulag camp — said Monday that after months of disputes with the authorities, attempts to preserve the museum have been ""exhausted,"" and the memorial was ""beginning the process of self-liquidation.""  The museum had enjoyed government support for the first two decades after the Soviet collapse. But this changed ""drastically"" about three years ago, when the government cut its funding for the museum and disconnected water and electricity supplies, citing unpaid bills, the museum said in a statement.  http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/a...ys/517046.html"

The appeal came after Israel declared 234 hectares of West Bank territory to be state land, fueling concerns of a new spike in tensions with the Palestinians.  ""Such actions appear to point toward an increase in settlement activities and demonstrate that Israel is continuing to push forward in the consolidation of its control of the West Bank,"" said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.  ""Settlements are illegal under international law and the secretary-general urges the government of Israel to halt and reverse such actions in the interest of a just and comprehensive peace and a just final status agreement,"" he said.  The United Nations has repeatedly called on Israel to halt the expansion of Jewish settlements, which it views as an attempt to scuttle plans for a future Palestinian state by absorbing land that would be part of the new country.

Others may also have English heritage and be interested in the result, though.               But all cheek aside the truth of the matter is that this past election was a watershed event in ""British"" history. In this past election an ""independent"" party which polled with more than 30% nationwide support only wins 12% of parliament? Leaving us with the usual suspects of Tory, and Labour? Bollocks.          That's FPTP for you. One thing it has done is ignite a huge push for PR - real PR, not the shite we were offered last time - and with the proposed boundary changes that appear to work in favour of the Tories, Labour has no option but to support it.                 This election proved that there is no longer such a thing as politics in Britain. The Tories made a mistake and the people said no. The nuances of the mistake are another discussion obviously lost on this lot.          Well, we can't blame them for that. British elections are archaic compared to other countries and we can't blame them for wondering why millions of votes doesn't get a seat whereas in another area, thousands are enough to get a seat.        But the fact remains that this election proved that Britain has always been and forever will be a 2 party system. If you don't understand the impact of this it's because you don't understand that we are completely under control.           lol I figured that out a long time ago.                Did you really think that UKIP could win a Parliamentary majority?          Of course not. From the support and pre-election polls, it wasn't unreasonable to expect three or four though.               A better question would be that even if they did win do you think that the mysterious ""powers that be"" would allow the public to know that?          Of course not. We are all well aware of electoral fraud and cover-ups.  Look at Lutfur Rahman and Tower Hamlets. Everyone knew from the day he was elected that it was a massive fraud but it took four years to do anything and only then because Nick Clegg got himself upset about it.               If you think that it could be possible for a party such as UKIP standing on a platform that is directly contrary to the ""direction"" that we are moving in perhaps you should watch this video for a better understanding of who wins in every election. Everywhere.          Thanks, but I'm well aware of political machinations. Eventually though, it becomes so obvious that support is at an overwhelming level that they have no choice but to let one or two stand. I'm convinced this is what happened in the NW and Yorkshire with the MEP elections.                  Once you understand this it's clear, if you thought politics in England was a laugh you would see it's the same song all over. When you realise this you might be able to see that politics are a joke. If you can divine the direction you already know what will happen.          I've understood this for years. The thing is, as I keep saying, although UKIP may never be the majority government, whilst they are a lurking threat then the other parties have no option but to try and neutralise that threat and they do that by adopting their policies.  Dave has just told the EU to do one over the fixed quota of boat people - something he never even mentioned till UKIP began yelling about it. Of course, I suspect this is because he can then turn round and tell the people ""look. We don't need to leave the EU. Uncle Dave can keep them in line just fine"".  He is aided in this by the EU backing down - of course they would, they don't want us to leave any more than Dave wants us to. All for show and all to influence the EU referendum.  Nonetheless, that's one load less of people putting strain on our services so it's a minor victory and it is thanks to UKIP. Continued support is thus justified."

The accusations re-emerged shortly before Janner's death, and although the Crown Prosecution Service considered that there was enough evidence to merit prosecution,[4] they decided that it would not be in the public interest as Janner had been diagnosed as suffering from dementia.[5] This decision was overturned on review,[6] although Janner was ruled unfit to plead.

The divorced civil rights activist, who sparked a national debate on race, has no black relatives dating back to 1671, an investigation by Daily Mail Online revealed previously. In fact her family were entirely white including some who were Mormons.  Yet the 37-year-old insists she 'didn't deceive anybody' - presenting herself as being black for years.  Instead she claims that it was the public's definition of race that was to blame for the confusion.  'It's taken my entire life to negotiate how to identify,' she said in an interview with Vanity Fair.  'You can't just say in one sentence what is blackness or what is black culture or what makes you who you are.'  'I just feel like I didn't mislead anybody; I didn't deceive anybody. If people feel misled or deceived, then sorry that they feel that way, but I believe that's more due to their definition and construct of race in their own minds than it is to my integrity or honesty, because I wouldn't say I'm African American, but I say I'm black, and there's a difference in those terms.'  Dolezal has previously told NBC's Nightly News she was 'definitely not white. Nothing about being white describes who I am.'  Her deceptions came to light six weeks ago after her parents Larry and Ruthanne Dolezal told a local paper in no uncertain terms that their daughter had been born Caucasian.  Her estranged parents have previously said that she began 'disguising' herself as black around 2007.  But Dolezal denies she has changed her appearance to seem black. Her hair is worn in tight brown curls - a far cry from the blonde locks of her youth.  'It's not a costume,' she told Vanity Fair. 'I don't know spiritually and metaphysically how this goes, but I do know that from my earliest memories I have awareness and connection with the black experience, and that's never left me. It's not something that I can put on and take off anymore.'  In response to her tanned complexion, she previously explained she doesn't 'stay out of the sun.'  Speaking to NBC BLK she admitted her hair was a weave - despite posting in earlier Facebook posts that she was going for 'the natural look' with the style.  She added to MSNBC that she had always felt a connection to 'the black experience'.  'From a very young age I felt a spiritual, visceral, instinctual connection with black is beautiful,' she said. 'Just the black experience and wanting to celebrate that...

Israel had no advance warning of Friday's rampage that killed at least 129 people, but within hours of it happening gave France information about some of the Islamic State militants who claimed to have carried it out, the top-rated television station Channel Two said, quoting an unnamed senior Israeli official.  Without providing details, Channel Two said Israeli intelligence saw a ""clear operational link"" between the attack in the French capital, Thursday's Beirut suicide bombings and the Oct. 31 downing of a Russian airliner in the Egyptian Sinai.  Israeli spy services are monitoring Syria and Iraq - where Islamic State insurgents have conquered swathes of territory -  which may have yielded intelligence on the organisation of the Paris attacks, Israel's Army Radio said.  Israeli officials contacted by Reuters had no comment, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Saturday: ""I've instructed Israel's security and intelligence services to assist their French counterparts and counterparts from other European countries in any way possible.""  A Western diplomat said last year that Israel was providing the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State with information gleaned from international travel databases about Western citizens suspected of joining the insurgents.

The Administrative Court in Saarlouis, in the federal state of Saarland, ruled last week that refugees in Bulgaria were faced with the risk to remain homeless in the streets and were practically left without medical care, according to Deutsche Welle.  The court also said that the refugees had no chance to work in Bulgaria and the country’s government was doing nothing for the integration of those people.  The plaintiff in the case was a Syrian woman who had fled with her Lebanese husband and travelled through Bulgaria to Germany, where she applied for asylum. The request was refused and they were to be sent back to Bulgaria in line with the provisions of the Dublin Regulation.  The Dublin Regulation establishes the Member State responsible for the examination of the asylum application. The criteria for establishing responsibility run, in hierarchical order, from family considerations, to recent possession of visa or residence permit in a Member State, to whether the applicant has entered EU irregularly, or regularly.  With Bulgaria described as unsafe country of origin by the court a deportation is impossible, according to Saarbrücker Zeitung.  The court ruling is not final and can be appealed.  There are 16 similar cases in the federal state of Saarland which can be influenced by the decision of the Administrative Court in Saarlouis, Saarbrücker Zeitung said.  The decision has already drawn fire from the governing Christian Democratic Union (CDU).  The deputy chairman of the CDU faction in Saarland parliament Roland Theiss has told Saarbrücker Zeitung that other German courts had confirmed Bulgaria as a safe country to which refugees could be sent back.  ""While life is not easy for refugees in Bulgaria, Germany simply can’t accept all those who are persecuted in their homeland. Whoever is fleeing war is entitled to protection in Europe, but not everyone is entitled to the social benefits in Germany,"" Deutsche Welle quoted Theiss as telling Saarbrücker Zeitung.  read full article at source: http://www.novinite.com/articles/173...0to%20Bulgaria"

Furthermore, they have assured us that any investigations into this are a waste of time because Jews would never lie.  This has got to be the biggest bunch of bull shit I’ve ever heard. How can any one possibly support these lying snakes?  From Reuters:  Israel will issue a report on Sunday arguing its 2014 Gaza offensive was lawful, a move aimed at pre-empting the release of findings of a U.N. war crimes investigation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed as a waste of time.  Launched after a surge of cross-border rocket fire by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, Israel’s two-month offensive last year, which included heavy shelling and air strikes into the densely populated enclave, killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians.  Sixty-seven Israeli soldiers and six civilians in Israel also died in the conflict.  “Whoever wants to know the truth, let them read this report,” Netanyahu, accusing Hamas of hiding behind non-combatants by deliberately operating in crowded Palestinian neighborhoods, told his cabinet in remarks made public.  read full article at source: http://www.dailyslave.com/lol-jew-te...waste-of-time/

German security authorities believed that several people had entered Germany during November and October travelling on Syrian passports with serial numbers similar to those in the possession of the terrorist group Islamic State, said Joachim Herrmann, the Interior Minister for the southern state of Bavaria.  Two of the bombers from last month's deadly Paris attacks were carrying passports with the same serial numbers, he said.  Concerns that people may have been sent to Germany by the Islamic State was the obvious conclusion, he said.  ""Unfortunately, no one knows where the refugees in question are now,"" Hermann said.  He was confirming a report published earlier on Tuesday in the mass-circulation Bild daily.  Citing security officials, Bild said the travel documents included legitimate passports stolen in al-Raqqa, Syria, Islamic State's self-proclaimed capital. They have been converted for use by persons other than the original holders.  Bild also reported that the passports showed the same forging characteristics as those held by two of the attackers in Paris on November 13. The two were checked as they entered the European Union through the Greek island of Lesbos.  It said the passports of the migrants to Germany had been copied by the authorities as their holders entered the country. No fingerprints had been taken of the holders, who might or might not be genuine refugees.  Another German press report said on Sunday that Islamic State had managed to seize a large number of genuine passports in Syria, Iraq and Libya. The Sunday edition of Die Welt put the number at tens of thousands.  The German authorities confirmed a report in March that around 3,800 blank Syrian passports had been seized by Islamic State in al-Raqqa.  Under an anti-terrorism law introduced in 2006, terrorism suspects can be held for up to six days if there is a serious risk of an imminent act of terrorism, or for international cooperation. Then they must be charged or released.  read full article at source: http://about.hr/en/news/europe/migra...w-germany-4066"

Willis Carto, who died in October at the age of 89, was a founder of the Liberty Lobby, a white supremacist organization, and the Institute for Historical Review, which promotes Holocaust denial.                    In a letter published in 1966, he wrote that ""Hitler's defeat was the defeat of Europe. And of America.""                    But Carto qualified for burial in Arlington National Cemetery, across the river from Washington DC, by virtue of the Purple Heart he won while fighting, and being wounded, in the Philippines during World War II.                    Purple Heart recipients are among the veterans and family members of veterans who may be interred in Arlington's military cemetery - as long as they were subsequently honorably discharged and not convicted of a state or federal crime.                    Jennifer Lynch, a spokeswoman for the cemetery, told the Huffington Post that a person’s political views do not have any bearing on their eligibility for burial.                    ""He was laughing about it: 'I’m probably America’s biggest Hitler fan, but I'll be buried alongside all these World War II vets,'’” said Todd Blodgett, a former FBI spy who kept Carto under surveillance from 2000 to 2002.                    One of the some two dozen people attending Carto's funeral on Wednesday described him as a “great man.”                    “He stood up for the best interests of this country and against all the special interests, who would like to see us submerged into this polyglot, one-world - whatever you want to call it,” said the man, who called himself Joel.                    He then confirmed that the “special interests” were the Jews.                    “Of course,"" he said. ""Who else?""                    “It is unfortunate that someone with Carto’s views gets to be buried in our national cemetery, but if he meets the criteria there is not much that can be done,” said Marilyn Mayo, a spokeswoman for the Anti-Defamation League. “The government cannot be tasked with whether or not to bury someone based on their ideology.”  read full article at source: http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/1.704157"

If we were to filter out only the more intelligent members of our race vs. Asians, it would tell a different story. Our people would be innovating and they'd be following us around trying to find things to copy.  A lot of Asians share work with each other and cheat too. They're not as individualistic as whites, or care as much about making it on their own merits.  In fact there was a recent news article where thousands of them got busted for cheating. Here's one article, though it's not the one I was looking for: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/0...n_7167560.html (look at 'Goldberg' trying to cover it up) -- not to mention Asians benefiting from Affirmative Action and quotas.  I never saw too many Asians in the CS courses I took at University. A lot of the more intelligent CS and Engineering students I knew were Russians. But still the same applies, the few Russians that came over here and were excelling in STEM were of higher stock than the average American who was at school for liberal arts, or only there because their parents forced them, or because they wanted to party. Though there were plenty of intelligent White Americans (redundant) specifically in the STEM programs. There were a few intelligent Asians, yeah, but people exaggerate them dominating it. They're trying to flood the market with CS degrees now by getting more unqualified women or nonwhites into STEM, so you'll find more nonwhites but they don't really ever make it very far compared to white males/the few asian males who are actually competent .    To sum it up Asians are the perfect robot. Just wind them up and watch them go. I never met one that can actively think on their feet as an individual as they all have hive that mentality. They will constantly look to a source of authority above them to see if they are ""doing it right"" if their source of authority says jump off a cliff they do it.  As an aside this is probably one the many reasons  the elite jew world order crowd want rid of whites. Wayyy to individualistic and not willing to slave away in a factory for them 24/7."

Maybe he got saved in hopes that he may get closer to altergirls.  I can only speculate here.    As for Elisha, she gets painted with the ""jilted, angry ex-wife"" brush all too often.  I consider her a good friend and frankly in my opinion, she's mad at people taking up for his sick tendancies almost as much than she is the tendancies themselves.  We're supposed to be white nationalists here.  We're acting like a bunch of nigger who thinks (or rather doesn't care) that OJ did it.

We've listened to every pro-KAS angle that a white mind (or jewish one in some cases) can produce.  If there is a special place in the Christian heaven for people who take up for pedos, then they need to expand it since lots more people will be going there after death apparently.    Its disgusting and if I hated Elisha's guts, it would still be.  KAS is a pedophile.  He admits it.  He expects people to understand it.  People do!!  I'm sitting here going, ""this is the kind of movement we're involved in?  Pedos are victims of bitchy wives??""  I can just imagine Elisha going, ""this was the kind of person I was married to?""    Maybe people here don't listen to me because I think a lot of Elisha.  Whatever.  She, minus KAS, is this:  funny as hell (humorous to no end, with lots to cry about), a great story teller (beats cable any day), a friend to animals (one of the more kind hearted people I have met), always ready to do something fun or meet someone new, no trip is too far for her when it comes to the cause, and a generally supportive person.  But on here, she's a mean woman who put her prescious little husband in prison and destroyed him rather than just divorce him.  Ok.  There are too KAS's---one a pedo who says he's a pedo, and another one who is a framed White Nationalist leader.  There are also two Elisha's then:  ugly SPLC bitch wife Elisha and fun, out-going, cute loyal friend Elisha.  Is thats whats going on here?  A rip in the dimensions where people come in from Bizzaro World?    I don't know.  I just know that over the time I've known her, she's been 10 times the friend to me that I've been to her.  I haven't talked to her in a while but when I need a pickmeup, I'll be keying in her number.  Thats the kind of friend I am anyway, I call when I need something.

This includes 219 illegal overstays from Afghanistan, 681 from Iraq, 564 from Iran, 56 from Libya, 1,435 from Pakistan, 440 from Syria, and 219 from Yemen, according to the report.

Melvin Reynolds  Photo: AP    A disgraced former Illinois Congressman is under arrest in Zimbabwe after allegedly taking hundreds of nude photos and pornographic videos.  Melvin Reynolds, whose promising political career crashed in 1995 after he was convicted of statutory rape involving a 16-year-old campaign worker, was in the African country while serving as a middleman for foreign investors in tourism.  Reynolds, 62, was arrested in a hotel in Harare, the Zimbabwe capital, on Monday on pornography charges and for remaining in the country illegally on an expired visa.  Reynolds also ran up $24,500 in bills at two hotels, according to the state-owned newspaper the Herald.  It said he brought several Zimbabwe models to his hotel room and took nude photos and video of them. A source told the newspaper, “He conducted the acts in the hotel room when he was guarded by four personal aides that were on his payroll.”  Possession of pornography is a crime in Zimbabwe.  The former Rhodes scholar and Harvard graduate had been one of the rising stars of the Illinois Democratic party when he ousted Rep. Gus Savage in a primary in 1992. Savage was vulnerable because a House ethics committee probe found that he had made improper sexual advances to a female Peace Corps volunteer.  But after one term in office, Reynolds was indicted on 12 counts of statutory rape, solicitation of child pornography and obstruction of justice. He was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison.  While behind bars he was convicted of fraud for concealing debts to obtain bank loans and diverting money from voter registration drives to his election campaign.  In one of President Clinton’s last acts in office, he commuted Reynolds’ fraud sentence in 2001.  Reynolds tired to make a political comeback in 2004 but was defeated by Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. in a Democratic primary.  After Jackson resigned and pleaded guilty of misusing campaign funds, Reynolds sought the vacated Congressional seat in 2012 but failed.  Zimbabwe officials said Reynolds entered the country in November on a 14-day visa that was not renewed.  The Herald said Reynolds claimed he had often been in Zimbabwe on political missions. “I have been in this country 17 times where I have done a lot of work for the people including the fight against sanctions,” the newspaper quoted Reynolds as saying.

The comparatively primitive technology available to nonwhites as well as still-there-but-fading xenophobic attitudes of First World nations ensured that few nonwhites would actually make it to Europe or the US. Fast forward to today. Technology, White guilt and a series of events feeding on themselves combine to produce this, a crossroads type crisis for Europe and the White race. Events like the Cologne attacks opened many eyes, but only strict border control and mass deportation will prevent a nonwhite Europe. And it must start happening NOW!!! Force muslim nations to take these vermin, they have the room and resources that White nations do not have to assimilate these beasts.

Niggers knew better than to come over and start anything around 'us'.  I helped that kid out in more ways than one.  I asked him which girl he likes the most, and it happened to be some chick that nobody was dating currently, and I sorta arranged it for him.  Few months later he walks up to me and says ""thank you dude, thank you!!"".  I didn't know what his deal was.  Turns out he got some pussy.

Speaking in his regular Friday morning interview with state broadcaster Kossuth Rádi&oacute;, the Prime Minister suggested that billionaire Hungarian-American financier George Soros is behind the leaders of the Democratic Party.  According to the Prime Minister, negative comments concerning Hungary, Poland and Central Europe in general, which have become more frequent since the migrant crisis, are not “casual slips of the tongue”. In explanation, he argued that “behind the leaders of the Democratic Party (…) we should see George Soros”, who has advocated for at least a million Muslims to be allowed into Europe each year, emphasising that Hungary is a barrier to this Soros-inspired American plan. In conclusion, he claimed in connection with the former President’s remarks, in which he said that Poland and Hungary “have now decided democracy is too much trouble, therefore “they want Putin-like leadership”, that “while the mouth is Clinton’s, the voice is that of George Soros”.  With his comments, Mr. Orbán joins several Hungarian cabinet members who have blamed the billionaire, who is one of the chief backers of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for attacks on Hungary. Speaking on Wednesday, foreign minister Péter Szijjárt&oacute; said that Bill Clinton’s claims concerning Hungary are a manifestation of billionaire Hungarian-American financier George Soros’s “dissatisfaction” with the Hungarian government’s policies, while cabinet chief János Lázár said on Thursday that Mr. Soros is “ready to take an active stance” against the Orbán government, “seen as one of his most dangerous enemies in Europe”, and claimed that Soros is behind US criticisms targeting Hungary and President Barack Obama’s pro-migration policies.  At a Thursday press conferencem White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he was unaware of Mr. Lázár’s comments, but added: “I’m not sure they’re worthy of a response”.  read full article at source: http://www.dailystormer.com/hungary-...nton-a-puppet/

Nationalistic parties and movements in Western Europe can point to Israel, a ""Jewish and democratic"" homeland, when it comes to the type of nation-state that will protect and preserve indigenous populations: e.g. a German and democratic homeland, where people who are German by blood have the right of return no matter what country they live in, and any non-German is treated with suspicion when it comes to acquiring citizenship (even if they have married an indigenous German); where a blood German can renounce his German citizenship, but will still be considered German in the eyes of the German nation if he ever changes his mind, and the government will even facilitate and encourage his return to the fold (whereas a non-blood German will have difficulties becoming a citizen); where Germans will be encouraged to marry among themselves, and people will be subsidized by the government to study and preserve German history and culture.  For the current generation of castrated Western Europeans, movements like PEGIDA represent a way forward, a compromise, where, under the guise of political correctness and Israel, they can start to assert their national aspirations without being deemed racist or hate-filled by the state and thrown in jail.  These ""judaized"" movements and parties (like Le Pen's FN and Wilders' Freedom Party) are really our only hope, the only parties that are gaining traction in Western Europe, and we should support them as first steps, rather than lamenting why Western Europeans can't be as bold as their eastern counterparts seem to be.    It seems a bit hypocritical for folks who are too scared to even use their real names on an internet forum to criticize these movements for not being hard-core racial enough, or being too-embracing of Israel or political correctness.  Once Western Europeans get to taste true freedom and sovereignty again, they will continue to evolve their governments accordingly."

A message posted on the Facebook page of Goldman Union Camp Institute, a Reform Jewish summer camp, said the camp had resumed its normal schedule.  ""Please know, the safety of your children is our highest priority,"" said the message signed by camp director Rabbi Mark Covitz and also sent to the parents of campers.  Indianapolis police say one child was critically injured and two others were in stable condition after the lightning strike Saturday afternoon. All three were hospitalized at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Their medical conditions were not available Sunday.  The injured campers were a 12-year-old Loveland, Ohio, boy and two 9-year-olds - a Chesterfield, Mo., girl, and a Kentucky boy, possibly from Louisville, police said. Police said several hundred children remained at the camp after the lightning strike.  The camp's website said it is a Reform Jewish summer camp serving children in the Midwest entering grades three to 12. ""GUCI is a place where children grow and mature into responsible, knowledgeable young Jewish adults,"" the website says. The camp has operated since 1958.  A message was left with a camp staffer Sunday seeking additional information. Carmen Siegel, who lives near the camp, told WRTV-TV the sky wasn't even dark when one clap of thunder caused her to jump into the air. ""It's tragic. I feel so sorry. There's nothing you could prepare because the sky didn't even get dark really,"" Siegel said.  Police said the children were in a field when the lightning strike occurred about 1:40 p.m. Saturday. Camp Counselors had begun lifesaving efforts before medics arrived to treat and transport the children.  http://www.sacbee.com/2013/06/29/553...mmer-camp.html  Even mother nature is doing its part to get rid of these assholes."

Therefore, if you want to break down a culture, go after its holidays, and replace them with new celebrations.  Celebrations of Valentine’s Day and the other “dominant holidays” are ending at one St. Paul elementary school, according to a letter from the principal addressed to families. Principal Scott Masini of Bruce Vento Elementary School, whose student body is overwhelmingly nonwhite, explained in the letter that “my personal feeling is we need to find a way to honor and engage in holidays that are inclusive of our student population.” St. Paul school kisses Valentine’s Day, other ‘dominant holidays,’ goodbye Paul Walsh, Star Tribune, January 29, 2016  So what holidays does he think would be “inclusive”?  With Valentine’s Day a little more than two weeks away, Masini noted, “I have come to the difficult decision to discontinue the celebration of the dominant holidays until we can come to a better understanding of how the dominant view will suppress someone else’s view.” Masini said there will be no cards or treats brought to school to mark Valentine’s Day.  Sorry kids, no Valentine treats, while your principal figures all this out.  All these are traditional American holidays, all with deep roots in our Anglo-Western culture.  “Because Saint Paul Public Schools is a diverse district that is filled with families from around the world we strive to respect all cultures and all students. We recognize that not every student celebrates or participates in some or all holidays. We have a board policy that discourages programs and festivities that celebrate observances unless they are required by law,” a statement from St. Paul schools later Thursday said.  Even in less diverse times, there have always been Americans who didn’t celebrate certain holidays for various reasons. And it wasn’t a big problem. Simply let them opt out of the celebrations and engage in an alternative activity. Why cancel the holiday for everybody else?  Was it really complaints from the student body and parents that caused this, or just educrat-induced PC paranoia? I imagine most of the kids in the school, of whatever background, would enjoy celebrating “dominant holidays”.  read full article at source: http://www.dailystormer.com/minnesot...nant-holidays/

Tehran and Islamabad agree that dialogue is the way to resolve the conflict, in which Houthi rebels have clashed with forces loyal to the country's internationally backed president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi — but they differ on how to proceed to such talks.  Sartaj Aziz, the Pakistani prime minister's adviser on foreign affairs, appeared at a joint news conference with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Aziz suggested that the U.N. Security Council adopt a resolution to enforce a cease-fire in Yemen, place an embargo on arms supplies and disarm the Houthis.  Zarif, who was expected to urge Islamabad to reject a Saudi request that it join a military operation against the Shi'ite Houthis, disagreed, saying Yemenis should decide how to end the conflict.

This establishment once again shows it has absolutely no, zero, expectation of Blacks to conduct themselves in a civilized and proper manner.  All of the coverage of this and other similar incidents across the country is plagued with the emphasis being put on the police to change, for the police to reform, this is easy to see. As I have said for a while, this is a campaign to neutralize the police across this country to where eventually there will be literally nothing done to stop Negro criminals, no matter what they do.  This groid could have played a role, reformed himself, altered his own behavior, and surely been alive today had he made different choices before and during the traffic stop and I will list a number of things to prove this point.  1 - Have your driver's license with you at all times. Doesn't seem that hard, in fact I have never decided to drive without it, most civilized citizens find no problem with this either.  2 - Do not drive with a bottle of alcohol in the floorboard of your vehicle, again something pretty easy for most to accomplish.  3 - Don't tell the police officer to go do something, this thug was telling the officer to go and look his name up. Again this could have been prevented if he managed to accomplish point #1, but still could have done much to keep the officer off his toes by just saying he didn't have a license, as the officer was trying to lead him into admitting.  4- Don't try to close the car door on the car if the officer tries to open it, take the belt off if he requests you to do so. I don't think many would appreciate an officer going for their car door, I know I wouldn't, but then again I can manage to accomplish points 1 through 3 as well, and most other citizens do as well and most never have an officer try to open their car door. Even if unprovoked, not complying with an officer opens you up to the possibility of bodily harm or death. I say this as someone who was unjustly arrested earlier this year while engaging in political activism, I made the choice to not make the situation worse and try to resist arrest, I was able to come away with the bogus charge being dismissed later on.  Again where is the expectation of proper and civilized behavior on the part on the Negro population, it is simply not there on the part of this establishment.  5 - Finally, driving away from a traffic stop in the manner this thug did is simply something that is against the law, it can put the officer's life in danger and most people will understand the officer taking measures to protect himself.  I had some measure of respect for this Joe Deters before now, the fact that he says the officer ""purposefully killed"" this yard ape is just reprehensible, again we have the establishment simply throwing their hands up and saying ""we just have given up on Blacks ever being civilized and proper in their behavior and actions, if we ever even thought they could ever be, and now everyone must now just tolerate their savage chimp-like behavior.""  The political prostitutes that are a part of and who serve the Jewish masters of this establishment are not most people these days, it is just sick how the Jews can however use the profane power of the mass media to make people THINK that everyone else thinks this was a ""tragedy"". I have to say I truly feel bad for this officer, even though the darkie was slow to stop I felt he was very professional and nice during the stop, many other cops would have went off on the thug soon into that exchange, he never raised his voice or was disrespectful.  The worthless, arrested 60 times with goodness knows how many illegitimate future thugs and savages he has sired, (the unofficial count is in the teens I guess) Black thug escalated that entire event into a shooting when he stepped on the gas, it was completely his fault, only this rotten establishment can twist it into something else.  Reality is so warped in this age, it is just a miracle that a sane and decent man or woman can make it day to day, this world is completely out of its mind.  So this society will ruin a man who certainly has more to offer the society (I know many despise cops, I have my moments where I do as well) than this run-of-the-mill Negro thug all because he eliminated the presence of this worthless piece of garbage Samuel Dubose. This Negro thug's life, and I mean this 110%, means nothing, IT DOESN'T MATTER. It didn't matter because he chose to not make it matter, as do millions of Negroes in this country who exist as one big collective anchor on the society.  This officer's life mattered, like the job or not he worked a steady job and probably gave more to society than he took.  Every White police officer in this country needs to take a good long look in the mirror, really reflect on how quickly the loyalty of the system they serve will be erased, all because they choose to do what is necessary to do their job or even just survive when interacting with Negroes.  And all other Whites who are tired of it need to do more than just complain about it online too. Any future press conference that is held surrounding this case should have thousands of Whites present jeering the White political prostitutes who are just going along as expected, shut that thing down.  You can be sure that you have seen the time arrive when all of this nonsense ends, it begins to end that occasion in the future when you go on to the Internet to read about a story like this and no one is online posting about it, they are instead out on the streets, in the face of the enemy, fighting against it and to end it."

General Ayad al-Lahabi tells The Associated Press that the military, backed by divisions of the Popular Mobilization Forces and coalition airstrikes, gained control Friday of the towns of Al-Malha and Al-Mazraah, located 3 kilometers south of the Beiji oil refinery, killing at least 160 militants with ISIS.  Al-Lahabi says security forces are trying to secure two corridors around the refinery itself after the Sunni militants launched a large-scale attack on the complex earlier this week.  Iraqi security forces, also backed by the Popular Mobilization Forces and U.S. airstrikes, recaptured the provincial capital of Tikrit on April 1.

AP:  Pope Francis added his voice Wednesday to the feminist anthem of equal pay for equal work, saying it’s “pure scandal” that women earn less than men for doing the same job.  Francis also lambasted the attitude of those who blame the crisis in families on women getting out of the house to work. He said such attitudes are a form of “machismo” that shows how men “want to dominate women.”  Francis made the comments during his Wednesday general audience, which he has been devoting to different aspects of family life before a big meeting on family issues in October.  Francis said the “radical equality” that Christianity proposes between husband and wife must bear new fruit.  “We should support with decisiveness the right to equal pay for equal work,” he said. “Why is it a given that women must earn less than men? No! They have the same rights. The disparity is pure scandal.”  Francis has spoken out frequently about how the Catholic Church in general must give greater value to the “feminine genius,” and has called for women to take on greater decision-making roles in the church, though he has ruled out women’s ordination or having women head Vatican congregations.  As everyone who is not a woman is aware, the “77 cents” gibberish is a stupid hoax.  Even the mainstream media has repeatedly admitted this, but these stupid bitches just keep on chanting it.  Wall Street Journal  I’m unsurprised the Pope jumped on this hoax, as he has repeatedly proved himself a hoax-loving scam artist.  Next he’s going to be telling us that sixty billion Jews were gassed and made into lampshades by Adolf Hitler.  read full article at source: http://www.dailystormer.com/faggot-p...ts-hoax-chant/

In a television interview, she said she was open to discussing reduced interest rates and extended maturity dates.  But Mrs Merkel said this would happen only after details of the latest bailout had been agreed, and reiterated that there would be no debt write-off.  Meanwhile France's president called for the creation of a eurozone government.  Reviving an idea originally put forward by former European Commission chief Jacques Delors, Francois Hollande proposed ""a specific budget as well as a parliament to ensure democratic control"" of the eurozone.  ""What threatens us is not an excess of Europe but its insufficiency,"" Mr Hollande wrote in a French newspaper.  The 19 countries that use the euro are members of an informal body, the Eurogroup, made up of each country's finance minister.  The complex negotiations earlier this month over whether to grant Greece a third bailout exposed vastly different points of view between the various eurozone members.  'Not now, but then'  Germany, which is the largest contributor to Greek rescue funds, has taken a tough line on Greece.  Both Greece and one of its key creditors, the International Monetary Fund, have been arguing for a restructuring of its €320bn debt, saying its current position is ""unsustainable"".  But Mrs Merkel said again on Sunday that ""a classic haircut of 30, 40% of debt cannot happen in a currency union"".  ""Greece has already been given relief. We had a voluntary haircut among the private creditors and we then extended maturities once and reduced interest rates,"" she said in an interview with ARD TV to be broadcast later on Sunday.  ""And we can now talk about such possibilities again... once the first successful review of the programme to be negotiated has been completed, then exactly this question will be discussed - not now, but then,"" she said.  The €80bn (£57bn; $88bn) bailout deal agreed after some 17 hours of talks between eurozone leaders last week was conditional on Greece imposing tough new reforms of its taxes, pensions and labour market, as well as privatising key state assets.  The conditions - harsher than those proposed by the eurozone in earlier negotiations - angered many in Greece who called it a ""humiliation"".  Greece had been given ""a choice of being executed or capitulating"", its former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told the BBC on Saturday.  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras himself said it was a deal he did not believe in but was the only way to ""avoid disaster for the country"" - and managed to get the necessary legislation approved by parliament on Wednesday.  As a result, the European Council has approved a €7bn bridging loan which will enable Greece's banks to open on Monday, and enable Athens to repay debts to the European Central Bank and the IMF due also on Monday.

1807888	2015-03-08 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	That photo of Rand Paul posing with Al Sharpton speaks volumes...	False	Doesn't suffer fools well	-JC	Ron Paul certainly has better hair than his son's    Don’t Be Fooled by the Federal Reserve’s Anti-Audit Propaganda  In  recent weeks, the Federal Reserve and its apologists in Congress and the media  have launched numerous attacks on the Audit the Fed legislation. These attacks  amount to nothing more than distortions about the effects and intent of the  audit bill.  Fed  apologists continue to claim that the Audit the Fed bill will somehow limit the  Federal Reserve’s independence. Yet neither [typically-Jew] Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen  nor any other opponent of the audit bill has ever been able to identify any  provision of the bill giving Congress power to dictate monetary policy. The only  way this argument makes sense is if the simple act of increasing transparency  somehow infringes on the Fed’s independence.  This  argument is also flawed since the Federal Reserve has never been independent  from political pressure. As economists Daniel Smith and Peter Boettke put it in  their paper “An Episodic History of Modern Fed Independence,” the Federal  Reserve “regularly accommodates debt, succumbs to political pressures, and  follows bureaucratic tendencies, compromising the Fed’s operational  independence.”  The  most infamous example of a Federal Reserve chair bowing to political pressure is  the way Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns tailored monetary policy to  accommodate President Richard Nixon’s demands for low interest rates. Nixon and  Burns were even recorded mocking the idea of Federal Reserve  independence.   Nixon  is not the only president to pressure a Federal Reserve chair to tailor monetary  policy to the president’s political needs. In the fifties, President Dwight  Eisenhower pressured Fed Chairman William Martin to either resign or increase  the money supply. Martin eventually gave in to Ike’s wishes for cheap money.  During the nineties, Alan Greenspan was accused by many political and financial  experts — including then-Federal Reserve Board Member Alan Blinder — of  tailoring Federal Reserve policies to help President Bill Clinton.  Some  Federal Reserve apologists make the contradictory claim that the audit bill is  not only dangerous, but it is also unnecessary since the Fed is already audited.  It is true that the Federal Reserve is subject to some limited financial audits,  but these audits only reveal the amount of assets on the Fed's balance sheets.  The Audit the Fed bill will reveal what was purchased, when it was acquired, and  why it was acquired.   Perhaps  the real reason the Federal Reserve fears a full audit can be revealed by  examining the one-time audit of the Federal Reserve’s response to the financial  crisis authorized by the Dodd-Frank law. This audit found that between 2007 and  2010 the Federal Reserve committed over $16 trillion — more than four times the  annual budget of the United States — to foreign central banks and politically  influential private companies. Can anyone doubt a full audit would show similar  instances of the Fed acting to benefit the political and economic  elites?  Some  fed apologists are claiming that the audit bill is part of a conspiracy to end  the Fed. As the author of a book called End  the Fed,  I find it laughable to suggest that I, and other audit supporters, are hiding  our true agenda. Besides, how could an audit advance efforts to end the Fed  unless the audit would prove that the American people would be better off  without the Fed? And don’t the people have a right to know if they are being  harmed by the current monetary system?  For  over a century, the Federal Reserve has operated in secrecy, to the benefit of  the elites and the detriment of the people. It is time to finally bring  transparency to monetary policy by auditing the Federal Reserve. Copyright  © 2015 by RonPaul Institute.

1823911	2015-04-10 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Obama Orders Army to Pay Damages to Trans Man Kept from Women's Bathroom	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	The Obama administration has ordered the U.S. Army to pay damages for discriminating against a transgender worker by denying the one-time man access to the women’s bathroom after he “transitioned” to female, thus changing his “gender identity.”  Additionally, the administration has determined that the Army also discriminated against the employee by failing to use his new female name (Tamara Lusardi) and instead continuing to use the name the man was originally hired under. The case involves a military veteran who worked as a civilian software specialist at the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) in Redstone, Alabama. Lusardi served in the Army from 1986 to 1993 and claims he suffered in a hostile workplace when management and co-workers kept calling him “sir” after becoming a woman and legally changing his name.  This month the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the bloated federal agency that enforces the nation’s workplace discrimination laws, ordered the Army to pay up for violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by committing sex discrimination against Lusardi. The EEOC tweaked the 1960s federal law to include transgender to the mix, asserting that it constitutes “gender identity discrimination” and therefore falls under Title VII of the Civil Rights Law. The agency defines transgender as persons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.  In the order issued this month the EEOC writes that Lusardi was harassed because superiors used “male pronouns” after he identified as a woman and “referred to her using these male signifiers on at least seven occasions.” The Army also violated Lusardi’s rights by refusing to let him use the women’s bathroom, the EEOC asserts. The document includes testimony from an Army official explaining that Lusardi was assigned a single-user executive restroom because other female employees would feel “extremely uncomfortable having an individual, despite the fact that she is conducting herself as a female, is still basically a male, physically.”  Allowing a man to use the women’s bathroom would cause more problems than having the individual use a private restroom, the official, identified as the Deputy Program Manager of the Program Executive Office, goes on to explain. “I also thought that under the circumstances, the male restroom would be inappropriate. So, that was left to use the single use bathrooms.” Lusardi used the women’s bathroom anyways and management repeatedly asked him to use the gender-neutral executive restroom until he underwent the final surgery for the sex change because it was making other employees uncomfortable.  There is no cause to question that complainant—who was assigned the sex of male at birth but identifies as female—is female, the EEOC writes in its order. “And certainly where, as here, a transgender female has notified her employer that she has begun living and working full-time as a woman, the agency must allow her access to the women’s bathroom,” the EEOC says. “This ‘real-life experience’ often is crucial to a transgender employee’s transition.” The agency found that the Army’s actions were sufficiently severe or pervasive to subject Lusardi to a hostile work environment based on sex and ordered compensatory damages and attorney’s fees.  Under Obama the EEOC has spiraled out of control to meet the administration’s mission of operating a politically correct government. In fact, nearly half of federal agency rulings dismissing employee discrimination claims have been overturned under Obama, costing American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars in settlements. In one year alone this translated into an astounding $51.4 billion that federal agencies paid to settle discrimination claims that often had no merit, according to the government’s figures. In nearly 45% of discrimination claims thrown out by agencies across the U.S. government the EEOC stepped in and revived the cases. The number has increased steadily since Obama became president, according to the EEOC’s figures.  The agency has also taken legal action against private businesses across the nation accusing them of everything from discriminating against minorities for running criminal background and credit checks to discriminating against Muslims for not allowing hijabs on the job. Last year the EEOC even went after a Green Bay Wisconsin metal and plastic manufacturer for requiring employees to speak English at work. In that case the EEOC asserted that the Civil Rights Act protects employees from discrimination based on national origin, which includes the linguistic characteristics of a national origin group. Therefore, according to this absurd reasoning, foreigners have the right to speak their native language even during work hours at an American company that requires English.  read full article at source: http://www.libertynewsnow.com/obama-...om/article1281

Every jew you named is a hard worker.  If you don't believe it, you're a fool.  Not only that, you're dangerous because you discount your enemy.  If you think a roofer works harder than the average ceo of any company listed in the Wilshire 5000, you're a fool.  If you think a roofer works harder than the owner of a small restaurant or accounting firm, who spends most of the day in the A/C, you're a fool.  You can push that pretense to sell Redwing boots or Craftsman tools or Kodiak to blue collars--to stroke their egos--but it's fantasyland.  The vast majority of manual laborers are not intelligent enough to realize they're being pandered to.  You have a million blue collar pontificators for every one Eric Hoffer.  Physical labor has almost no bearing on compensation, other than to say the more you do the less likely you are to be near the top.  Compensation is based upon how much value you produce.  The fact is, individual blue collars don't and can't produce a lot of value because the human body can't do that much work.  If that's all you've got going for you, you aren't going to be greatly compensated in the grand scheme of things, particularly when 10 other guys can do the same job.  That doesn't devalue them as a person.  It's an economic fact of life.  Again, you can like it or not like it.  Are there white collars who are unfairly compensated?  Yes, mostly in cases of institutionalized fraud, as with the current judeo-financial sector.  But if you don't think jewish (and other) financial crooks are among the hardest workers around, you're a fool.  You think a kike like Dick Fuld at Lehman Bros. was lazy?  These guys sleep in their office--and not to make a political statement.  And even with all the world going for them, some of them still go under.  That's with the deck stacked in their favor!  It makes me wonder if you have actually experienced (ie, have performed and been around) manual labor for any length of time.  It's a certainty you don't know anything about society above the small, rural town level--and not then the top of the local structure.

The Basques like to compare themselves to the Irish or Palestinians, but unlike the latter, the differences between Basques and Spaniards are not significant other than their primitive language that is more of a novelty spoken by a minority of them, rather than something that radically differentiates them from other Spaniards.    Basque identity existed before, true.  So did Gaulic identity before the Romans and Franks, until all 3 came together and became what we know of as ""France"".   The Basques, whether they like it or not, are part of the Spanish ethnogenesis, as are Galicians, the Catalans, and others whose novel, slight cultural distinctions are actually less profound than the sub-cultures in the different regions of Germany.

They defend crimes against the Palestinian population and propagate their message by denying that the oppression of the Palestinians even exists.   One of the ways that they do this is through their defence of the construction of illegal settlements in the West Bank.  Stand With Us published a statement on the matter stating that the build-up of settlements should not be an obstacle to peace and that the real problem is the Palestinian leadership, including Israel's puppet Mahmoud Abbas.   Although the PA chief repeatedly reiterates his and the authority's recognition of Israel's existence within the 1967 borders, the Palestinians are, claim Stand With Us, ""refusing to accept Jewish nationalism while demanding   the acceptance of Palestinian nationalism."" Not only is this justifying Israeli violations of international law, such as Netanyahu's recent invitation for bids to construct 77 settlements in East Jerusalem, continuing the displacement of Palestinians, but also perpetuating an economy built on neo-slavery."

They have been reported to the police.  Pictures of the stickers, which have been stuck to objects on streets in Nybro, Småland, have been circulating on social media.  One of the stickers reads, in English: “Women who don’t wear a headscarf are asking to be raped.” Another reads: “No democracy. We just want Islam,” Fria Tider has reported.  The stickers have been reported to the police who are currently investigating who placed them there, but admitted that at the moment they do not know who is behind them.  The appearance of the stickers comes just weeks after a number of stickers appeared in nearby Emmaboda bearing the message “Multiculturalism is bad for your children and your grandchildren.” However, those stickers were emblazoned with ‘Nordfront’, the Swedish branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement, a national socialist movement. They were also stylised, made to look like the health warnings carried on cigarette packets.  But unlike the Nordfront stickers, the Islamist stickers feature plain white text on a plain dark grey background with no logo or marking to indicate who placed them. Consequently, while some people have argued that they were placed by newly arrived asylum seekers with an agenda to promote Islam in Sweden, others have argued that they could be the work of Swedes seeking to “incite hatred” against the immigrants.  In that respect, the controversy closely resembles a recent case in which leaflets were posted through letterboxes in Manchester, England, calling on British people not to walk their dogs in public in order for the area to be kept “pure” for Muslims.  “As citizens of a multicultural nation, those who live in the UK must learn to understand and respect the legacy and lifestyle of the Muslims who live alongside them,” the leaflets read.  They were distributed by a group called Public Purity, who stated on their website their intention to have all dogs removed from the public sphere in Britain to keep Muslims pure. “If dogs are not permitted to be present in public, Muslims could live their lives with a burden lifted from their shoulders and without having to fear being tainted with no fault of their own,” the group argued.  But it was unclear who was behind the campaign, leading to disagreement online over whether it was the work of Islamic fundamentalists or British nationalists as a false flag operation.  read full article at source: http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016...-women-warned/

The Enquirer/Glenn Hartong  A press conference about racial injustice turned ugly Wednesday when a small group of protesters, including a white supremacist, disrupted the event with shouts about ""black criminals.""  The meeting was sponsored by a group of Cincinnati ministers who said they want to use the All-Star Game spotlight to speak out about the criminal justice system and the recent deaths of black men in police custody.  It quickly degenerated, however, into a series of shouting matches, with the ministers struggling to be heard over the half-dozen protesters.  At one point, a frustrated Bobby Hilton, leader of Word Deliverance Ministries in Forest Park, urged the protesters to leave if they couldn't talk about the issues without yelling.  ""If you can't have an intelligent conversation, move on,"" Hilton said. ""Let's come together. Can we come together?""  ""Not at all,"" replied Robert Ransdell, who did most of the shouting.  Ransdell is a former candidate for senate in Kentucky and a member of the National Alliance, a group the Anti-Defamation League identifies as a white supremacist organization. ""How many decades are we going to accommodate the behavior of black criminals?"" he shouted as Hilton and the others tried to speak.  Other protesters carried signs that read, ""Diversity means chasing down the last white person, #whitegenocide.""  Chris Beard, pastor of Peoples Church in Cincinnati, said the disruptions were as disappointing as they were frustrating. ""We have to be able to talk about race in this country,"" he said. ""We have to talk about it.""  The Rev. Damon Lynch III compared the protesters to segregationists who tried to stop the civil rights movement decades ago.  ""What we saw today is nothing new,"" Lynch said. ""It's what we've seen in the civil rights movement from the beginning: Angry white people espousing their views, trying to stop us from moving forward.""  When they did get a chance to speak, the ministers called on Major League Baseball to use the spotlight of the All-Star Game in Cincinnati to take a stand against policies and practices that disrespect African-Americans. They cited recent police misconduct accusations in Baltimore, Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri, as well as the continuing prosecution of former Juvenile Court Judge Tracie Hunter in Cincinnati.  Hunter is facing a second felony trial on charges of forgery, tampering with evidence and theft in office. The jury in her first trial convicted her on one felony count, but was unable to reach a verdict on the others.  While prosecutors say Hunter abused her power as a judge, her supporters say she was targeted because she's an African-American.  Hilton and others vowed in March to use the All-Star Game spotlight to draw attention to the Hunter case and other racial issues.  ""The nation is going to hear about this,"" Hilton said in March.  On Wednesday, Hilton said he is not demanding a boycott of the All-Star Game, but he and the other ministers said they want Major League Baseball to speak out about racial injustice.  ""We're asking Major League Baseball to stand with us,"" Hilton said.  MLB did not respond to a request for comment."

Calais Migrant Solidarity (CMS), a local migrant aid association, released the video on Monday, alleging it documented a clear case of police brutality towards migrants, hundreds of whom seek to hide daily in lorries or cars as they queue up to board UK-bound ferries at the northern French port.   Police unions say they have no option but to use force when migrants from a string of war-torn countries, including Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria, Sudan and Somalia, refuse to leave vehicles and outnumber them.

The authorities are probing claims that 16 French soldiers abused children at a camp for internally displaced people.  The Guardian newspaper reported that a leaked UN report documented alleged abuses of children as young as nine.  France sent an initial 1,600 troops to the country in December 2013 after violence flared following a coup.  Mr Hollande said there would be ""sanctions in line with the amount of trust we put in the army"" for any soldiers found guilty of abuse.  ""I am proud of our armed forces, and so will show no mercy to those who have behaved badly, if that is the case,"" he went on.  The defence ministry has said the allegations, if proven, would be ""an intolerable attack on military values"".  The Guardian said that the alleged abuse took place between December 2013 and June 2014 at a centre for internally displaced people in the Central African Republic capital, Bangui.  Quoting an internal UN report, it says that in one case, a nine-year-old boy and his friend were forced to carry out a sex act by two French soldiers.  In some cases, it says, children were able to give good descriptions of the French soldiers alleged to be involved.  On Wednesday, the Guardian newspaper reported that a United Nations worker was suspended after leaking the report to French authorities.  A spokesman for the UN Secretary General said the leaking of an unredacted report constituted ""a serious breach of protocol"" and could endanger victims and witnesses.  France intervened in its former colony in December 2013, nine months after a rebel alliance, Seleka, captured the capital and ousted President Francois Bozize.  The country descended into ethnic and sectarian violence, with thousands of people fleeing their homes and the UN warning that there was a high risk of genocide.  The UN took over and expanded the African peacekeeping mission in September 2014."
1901963	2015-09-01 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Taxpayer Funds Used to Pay a Premium for Halal Food in U.S. Schools	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	Taxation for Islamization, via Federal Government Subsidizes Halal Food in Public Schools  In recent years, three American public school districts have provided taxpayer-supported lunches meeting Muslim students’ dietary standards. They have not similarly provided lunches satisfying any other students’ religious standards. The halal foods purchased with public funds are costlier than comparable non-halal foods.  This is problematic under the U.S. Constitution’s Establishment [1] and Equal Protection [2] Clauses. Even if a school district endeavors to provide all students with food satisfying each one’s religious requirements, it would arguably entangle the government in religious observance and so violate the separation of “church” and state. If a school district goes out of its way to provide food satisfying the religious requirements of only some [3] students, but not others, it risks illegally giving them unequal advantages and elevating [4] their religion over others. This is especially so given that the school food is paid for at least partly with public funds [5], although the schools have been reluctant to reveal how much tax money is involved.  Public schools in Dearborn [6], Michigan, first began offering halal lunches in 2001 [7]. That winter, the school district invited “proposals [8] from halal food distributors to provide food at several of its 28 public schools,” and began a pilot program [9]. Presently, according to David Mustonen, director of community and public relations for Dearborn Public Schools: “All schools have a halal option [10] five days a week.”  Dearborn Heights’ Crestwood School District started a halal food pilot program in 2013-14 [11]. Last year, Crawford High School in San Diego operated a pilot program [12] offering a halal lunch option twice a week.  Legislators in both New York City and New York state have proposed mandating public schools [9] to serve halal [13] food.  In February 2014, New York City Councilman Rafael Espinal [7] introduced a resolution [14] requiring New York City schools “to provide a halal lunch menu option.” Three [15]separate [16]bills [17] have been introduced in the New York State Assembly during the current (2015-16) term that would require public schools in big cities to offer halal lunch options. One [15] of them requires that the food be provided to Muslim students “at no cost.”  Media stories about lobbying efforts to serve halal food in New York City and San Diego public schools largely framed the issue as one of poor Muslim children going hungry because government-funded public schools failed to provide food satisfying their religious requirements (e.g., for San Diego: here [18], here [19], and here [12]; for New York City: here [13] and here [7]).  The articles presumed parents could not or would not provide lunches, or argued that unheated packaged lunches were insufficient to enable children to learn effectively.

Guede's father returned to Côte d'Ivoire in 2004. Guede, then aged 15, was adopted by a wealthy Perugia family.[41] Wow...so access to the privileges money brings didn't convert the nigger into a functional human? but this...this goes against everything i learned in sociology class...i am at a loss to account?? Burleigh writes that Guede was given his own flat in a gated villa, spent summer with the family in Sardinia and winter in the Dolomites, and was sent to a good school.[43] Any of you ever enjoy anything that nice? And he STILL fucked it up. He also played basketball for the Perugia youth team in the 2004–2005 season.[44] In his second year with the family, the relationship began to break down. And what do you think the leftist shitheads at wiki are leaving out by means of that evasion ""break down""? He dropped out of hotel management and computer training courses; the family then employed Guede as a gardener in a bed-and-breakfast they owned. Guede said he met a couple of the Italian men from the basement of Via della Pergola 7 while spending evenings at the basketball court in the Piazza Grimana at this time. In mid-2007 he was sacked from the gardening job and the family asked him to leave their home.[43][45][46]  The nigger has everything set up for him and he can't handle it. What a fucking nigger.

Unlike anything witnessed in recent political history, both sides of the right/left Zionist matrix have put aside whatever minor differences exist between them and have joined forces in preventing at all costs Trump from becoming the next occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington D.C.   Similar to the biblical warlord Joshua and his Israelite army assailing the walled city of Jericho with trumpet blasts and shouts prior to its invasion, destruction and then incineration, likewise not a day goes by where the world is spared the ear-splitting noise generated by the Jewish mainstream media, both in America and throughout the West, working in tandem to bring down Trump’s campaign.   As it pertains to Trump, it was decided decades ago in the aftermath of various business dealings and engagements involving him, both on Wall Street and within a New York real estate market that is as kosher as Manischewitz that in any political position he would not be ‘good for Israel’.   Both his independent coin and independent compass meant that he was beyond their reach, a point he himself acknowledged when he recently addressed the Republican Jewish Coalition and (rightly) attributed their cold reception to his candidacy to his not wanting their money and thus being beyond their control.  What Trump is saying to the Kristols, Krauthammers, Adelsons, Singers, et al who are indeed working in close cooperation with each other and with other as-of-this-moment unnamed individuals, both in the US and Israel, in making sure he does not win is that there are all sorts of skeletons in the political closet that Israel would really rather not be made part of the public discourse, and that with a mouth like his and with the hundreds of millions of ears who are glued to it, he could bring down the whole house of cards faster than these jermites who are gnawing away at the American political structure can get on a plane and head back to Israel, where their true allegiance lies.  Other evidence suggesting that indeed a very serious yet nuanced gang war is taking place between Trump and the organized Jewish power structure out to scuttle his presidency has been manifested in other ways as well.  Intelligent watchers of the present political drama can rightly speculate that indeed there is more to the candidacy of one Donald J. Trump than meets the eye…That at the vortex of this contest is a massive power struggle taking place, albeit in ways which seem to elude the notice of the average Joe 6-pack, and that in terms of human history, nothing in the past can compare in terms of the high stakes that are now involved.   It must be remembered that the types likely helping Trump along in this endeavor are professionals, types who understand human psychology like a master chef understands spices and recipes and who know exactly how to tickle, tweak, tantalize, and titillate the raw emotions of large groups of people in order to get the reaction needed for certain geo-political aims. It is these types therefore likely coaching Trump on certain positions he has taken, from the ‘celebrating Muslims on 9/11’ to halting Muslim immigration to his contrarian statements on the destruction of Iraq and Libya to keeping Assad in power and of repairing relations with Russia.  Trump–A Clear and Present Danger to ‘Greater Israel’  All of which of course can have but one result as far as ‘America’s only ally’ in the Middle East is concerned–Fury, rage, panic, paranoia and everything in between on the part of Benjamin Netanyahu and his extended Likud family, who are now looking at the prospect of another 4 (8?) years of intransigence, obfuscation and humiliation due to yet another American president who refuses to ‘get with the plan’.  As far as Trump, the United States and indeed an entire world standing on the precipice of an Israeli-engineered nuclear war are concerned, the ‘Teflon Don’ has been declared not just persona non grata, but indeed, the walking dead.   All of his positions, including his heretical statements concerning an ‘undivided Jerusalem’ (which Netanyahu & co view as the capital of their future Caliphate) coupled with his positions regarding Syria, Iraq, Libya, Iran, Russia, China, etc, have made clear to Netanyahu & co that the mathematics involved in the 2016 election are–as far as their thousands-of-years-old designs are concerned, very simple and yet very serious-  Donald Trump + 1600 Pennsylvania Ave = the dissolution of ‘Greater Israel’  As far a Netanyahu and his extended family in Likud are concerned, the ‘Caliphate’ known as ‘Greater Israel’ is not considered something transitory or trivial. It is nothing short of the will of Yahweh, the ‘god’ of the Jews, who made it Kristol clear thousands of years ago the nature of this particular real estate deal known as Israel.  more at: Donald Trump as an enemy of ‘Greater Israel’

As for the others, I understand Federal Money was involved as well. I take some issue with the removal of these monuments but I am really not surprised. When the niggers and kikes started seriously agitating for the Confederate Flag's removal from the Georgia State Flag and the flag from South Carolina's Statehouse in the 90's, everyone said that it would stop with the Battle Flag. Of course I and many Southern Whites knew different, and here we are. I say I take some issue of course-the niggers, kikes and BCLs run jew orleans and for them to erase Confederate History incenses me. However, I really wish a racially conscious White or Whites with money would offer to buy these Monuments and place them on private land where they would be repaired, maintained and respected. Of course jew orleans is just the biggest shitty city to erase history they don't like. Baltimore is in the process of removing two Monuments they disagree with. Other smaller cities are pondering the same thing. Of course union monuments are not even considered for removal.

1931633	2015-10-22 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	GOP Members Warn: 'America About to Break Every Immigration Record'	True	Senior Member	Ian Smith son	"""Did any American vote for this extreme and untested policy?""  ama Sen. Jeff Sessions and Virginia Rep. Dave Brat are warning that America is on the cusp of ""unprecedented levels of immigration"" over the next 10 years and said if politicians don't start curbing the   influx, there won't be much future left for the American people.  The dire warning came in a hard-hitting memo to the GOP that began with:  America is about to break every known immigration record. And yet you are unlikely to hear a word about it.  Both Sessions and Brat agree that too many politicians recklessly push ""immigration reform"" in their campaign promises without knowing what it should actually look like. Though they believe it's something   that is needed, they shout it from the rooftops without ever considering what effect immigration is having on schools, hospitals, police, jobs, poverty, you name it.   And at the end of the day, it isn't even apparent that they care what happens.  The senator and congressman define true immigration reform as something that actually benefits Americans first before it trickles down to immigrants. But they've noticed the exact opposite in the nation's capitol:  [I]n Washington, immigration reform has devolved into a euphemism for legislation that opens America’s borders, floods her labor markets and gives corporations the legal right to import new foreign   workers to replace their existing employees at lower pay.  Part of the Senate's ""gang of eight"" immigration bill in 2013, still lobbied by many immigration ""reformers,"" would in fact usher in low-wage H-1B workers to replace American workers,    offer ""the largest supply of visas"" for those low-skilled immigrants, transfer bargaining power and wealth from employee to employer, not to mention that Democrats would gain ""more political power.""  ""This is not immigration reform,"" the memo states. ""This is the dissolution of the nation state, of the principle that a government exists to serve its own people.""  The letter takes time to detail that middle-class growth in the 20th century was at its highest when immigration was at its lowest. Time and time again, history proves this.  But since Congress passed looser immigration laws in 1965, the foreign-born population has quadrupled to over 42 million today and Sessions and Brat warn that another 14 million immigrants are heading   this way over the next 10 years.  ""[T]hat’s almost five times the number of students who will graduate from public high school in America this year,"" their letter states.  ""Assuming no law is passed to reduce immigration, the Census Bureau estimates that, in less than eight years’ time, the percentage of U.S. residents born in a foreign-country will be the highest level in our history.   And the bureau estimates — again, assuming Congress does not reduce immigration rates — that the foreign-born population share will keep rising to new all-time records for as long as they can project.""  According to Pew Research projections over the next 50 years, there will be enough new immigrants and their children to fill 25 cities the size of Los Angeles.  ""Did any American vote for this extreme and untested policy?"" the letter asks rhetorically. ""Yet our politicians who have created this policy do print or speak a word about it. This remains the forbidden conversation.""  And so Sessions and Brat are asking for actual immigration reform that puts Americans first and offers limits to how many immigrants are allowed in. That is what will show true compassion to America's   struggling families, they argue, not the faux compassion of an open borders policy.  Lettered on our nation’s seal are the words E Pluribus Unum. Out of many, one. It does a disservice to both the country and the immigrant when we bring in larger numbers than we can reasonably expect to assimilate.   If we allow our immigration system to replicate in America the same failed conditions which people have left, we are hurting the country and any who would seek to enter it in the future.  After nearly half a century of massive immigration it is time to turn our attention to our own residents. It is time to help our own workers, families and communities — immigrant and U.S.-born —   rise together into the middle class.  Anyone running for the White House who cannot publicly commit to these principles should consider a different occupation. Americans should no longer have to wonder for whom their leaders work.

If it weren’t for liberals and a growing population of Third World parasites, White people in America would have put the first men on the surface of mars a long time ago. If we didn’t have the colossal financial bottomless pit of the Blacks and Latinos, we might have launched the first interstellar spacecraft to build a colony on an earth-like planet on a decades-long mission.  Our manned space program came to an inglorious and pathetic end in December, 1972 when Apollo 17 left the surface of the moon and returned to the earth. Since then, we’ve done little more than launch “astronauts” into low earth orbit and send out robot probes instead of men.  All the engineers, skilled workers and subcontractors, who might have played a role in a manned mission to mars had their future stolen from them. The heroic men and women who might have stepped off a lander to be the first astronauts on mars had their destiny destroyed, and for what? So that crooked liberal Democrats could build up a base of tens of millions of Third World voters as they attempt to create a permanent majority for their corrupt party.  The U.S. government squanders over a trillion dollars per year on hand out programs. Apparently there’s no limit to how much money will be given to parasites as long as they vote Democrat. Any thought of using some of the colossal federal budget even to duplicate the Apollo moon landing for a new generation of Americans is apparently out of the question.  An article from Space.com dated April 14, 2010 reports “Obama’s plans for NASA could be ‘devastating’ to the U.S. human space flight program and ‘destines our nation to become one of second- or even third-rate stature,’ three American astronaut heroes said Tuesday.”  “Neil Armstrong, who rarely makes public comments, was the first human to set foot on the moon (47 years ago today). Jim Lovell commanded the famous Apollo 13 flight — an aborted moon mission. And Apollo 17 commander Gene Cernan remains the last human to walk on the lunar surface.”  “In a statement e-mailed to longtime NBC space correspondent Jay Barbree of Merritt Island, all three took exception with Obama’s plan to cancel NASA’s return-to-the-moon program, dubbed Project Constellation.”  America under Barack Obama and the Democrat Party is a Third World nation and Third World nations don’t have advanced manned space programs. We need a radical change to become a great nation once again. We have a chance to change America’s direction this election. Let’s hope we’re still up to the task.  read full article at source: http://prowhiteparty.wordpress.com/2...tolen-from-us/

Without it, nothing else can exist.  The Yids are flipping their lids over a White Power group at a New Jersey high school.  I would like to give a personal “Sieg Heil!” shout-out to our brothers and comrades at Pascack Valley High School in Bergen County, and congratulate them on getting the ADL to respond to their brave actions in defense of their race.  In an open letter to students and faculty on Smoke Signals, the student news site for Pascack Valley High School in Hillsdale, the Pascack Valley Human Rights League detailed a series of alleged racial and ethnic slurs directed at students at Pascack Valley High School, according to the ADL.  The alleged incidents include: formation of a white supremacist club, swastikas drawn in the hallway and in bathrooms, uses of the “n” word and other racial slurs, and white power signs displayed by students at sporting events and on social media, according to the ADL.  On the school’s “Smoke Signals” website, bitter bitches called for action against the brave young defenders of Western Civilization.  “These allegations, if true, are deeply disturbing,” said Joshua Cohen, ADL New Jersey Regional Director. “Schools must provide safe environments free of racism, prejudice and bigotry, which facilitate learning and understanding among students from diverse backgrounds. We urge the district to investigate and address these allegations.”  In other word: “shut it down!”  That is really the only phrase these Jew organizations need, as it is all they are ever saying. I am tired of the endless babbling of these groups and would much prefer it be simplified. The ADL could, for instance, replace their entire website with a picture of the gates of Auschwitz and the words “shut it down,” and it would be understood to have the same meaning.  Superintendent Erik Gundersen said these actions were performed by a small group of students who “subscribe to white supremacist viewpoints,” according to nj.com. Some of these students have been disciplined, and he said the school is taking the matter very seriously.  The ADL said it has reached out to the superintendent of Pascack Valley Regional High School District, encouraging the school to take to investigate and address the situation. The ADL has also offered to work with administrators to address bias, bigotry, and bullying.  “We hope the district will take us up on this offer,” the organization said in a statement.  “We are in your base, indoctrinating your children.”  I think the White Power club is a great idea, and would encourage our high school readers (there are a lot) to form such clubs. However, I would advise you to avoid trouble, and keep your beliefs as secretive as possible. Devise some sort of membership scheme, and only allow in those whom you trust. Keep a low profile, but stick together, educate one another and engage in healthy activities   ----- snip -----   read full article at source: http://www.dailystormer.com/nazi-clu...dish-apoplexy/

Running for office on nothing but the issue of Pakistanis pimping white drug-abusing runaways is in the larger scheme a ""so what"" question. Niggers and Pakis rape people all the time, and UKIP, while lingering on the matter, doesn't propose any real solutions to this except making Pakis eat bacon after they're done raping you.  On every issue the people Rotherham care about, UKIP is weak, including immigration (talking about nothing but Poles and ""Judeo-Christian heritage"". Might work in Texas, but not where people have even half a brain) but especially on economics.    Working class industrial areas like Rotherham are voting for Labour simply because they're telling them (lies) about solving unemployment and proposing solutions to the destruction of the middle class you're seeing everywhere in the white world. This is the same reason why whites vote Democrat even if they wholeheartedly disagree with their social policies. UKIP's agenda is more or less Reagonomics/Thatcherism/Toryism, and people being screwed by the capitalist system rightfully dismiss them as the party of the rich.   You big tent ""unite the right"" types are like high school nerds putting up pictures of the captain of the cheerleader squad in your locker and telling everyone she's your girlfriend. Just because you want it to be true, doesn't mean UKIP doesn't despise you. UKIP doesn't want your vote, your endorsement, or your moral support, their whole agenda is to channel white frustration into the black hole they embody, and anyone who actually cares about their country is a detriment to this agenda."

True	News Bot	NewsFeed	"The far-right Jobbik party in Hungary has won its first ever individual constituency seat in parliament.  It took the Tapolca seat with a majority of just under 300 votes.  Jobbik looks set to present a major challenge to the governing Fidesz party in parliamentary elections due in three years' time.  Correspondents say the party has softened its rhetoric in recent years and has gained support from mainstream voters.  Lajos Rig's margin of victory was narrow, but his win was symbolically enormous, says the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest.  ""The mood in Hungary is for a change of government and with Jobbik Hungary finally has a force to change the government,'' party leader Gabor Vona told supporters in Tapolca.  It re-enforces their reputation as the most successful nationalist party in Europe and is another setback for Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban.  ""There are times when the ball hits the post,"" said Mr Orban, a keen footballer, on his Facebook page as he admitted defeat.  Fidesz easily won the last national and European elections in 2014, when Jobbik took around 20% of the vote.  But since then the governing party has seen its reputation falter, with allegations of corruption, and opposition to measures like a planned internet tax and limits on Sunday trading.  Fidesz lost its two-thirds parliamentary majority in February after another by-election defeat.  read full article at source: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32281713"

It won't cause mass starvation to do away with welfare.   However, employment must be available to all.   Cheap goods must be available so that even the people with the shittiest low-paying jobs can still sustain themselves (and their families).   Having a strong family structure in society is also an important factor. The family is the natural safety-net; it's not a coincidence that when the nation waxes, the family wanes. In fact, you could say the extended family structure is a fierce rival to the power of any nation-state. That's why the state does its best to make the family structure obsolete.  People have to be willing to work. But, if their choice is work or starve - believe me, they will work.

Alvita Wilson-Willis, 40, was being held today in the Beaver County jail on charges of unlawful restraint, false imprisonment and luring a child into a vehicle.  The children, who range in age from 4 to 10, told police they were walking their dog in the 1000 block of Main Street Saturday afternoon when Ms. Wilson-Willis told them to come inside her apartment because she had gifts for their mothers.  While inside the apartment, Ms. Wilson-Willis escorted the children into her bedroom, where she played card games with them on her bed, according to a criminal complaint. The complaint also alleges that Ms. Wilson-Willis put makeup on two of the girls and styled their hair.

""This is a responsible deal and Israel should also take a closer look at it and not criticise the agreement in a very coarse way,"" Steinmeier told German broadcaster ARD in an interview on Wednesday.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the deal as a ""stunning, historic mistake"" and said it would enable Iran to pursue a path to nuclear weapons.  But Steinmeier said the basis for the agreement was transparency and the ability to monitor Iran's compliance.  ""In the agreement, Iran has to commit to these monitoring possibilities. And we will make sure that the monitoring possibilities are also observed after this deal,"" he said.

(In other words, for anyone needing a transfusion your risk of getting HIV is going up)	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	The Obama administration, more interested in pleasing its LGBT supporters than in protecting the health of the general public, is proposing “new rules” through the FDA that would terminate the 32-year-old ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men.  Hilariously, the FDA would still ban gay men from donating if they confess to having sex with a man within a year before donating blood.  The FDA did admit that “some individuals knowingly donate despite the deferral.”  The American Medical Association, which endorsed same-sex marriage in 2011, was thrilled, stating the change was “a step in the right direction to end the lifetime ban that prohibits men who have had sex with men (MSM) from ever donating blood.”  The American Red Cross and America’s Blood Centers echoed their support; they have called the ban “medically and scientifically unwarranted,” according to The Hill.  According to the FDA, the BOTS Working Group, comprised of members from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), HHS Office of Civil Rights, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), and FDA, considered the idea of conducting a pilot study to estimate the effect of changing the policy and allowing gay men to donate blood.  But the BOTS Working Group “decided that such a pilot study examining the potential effects of a policy change would not be feasible. Instead, the BOTS Working Group determined that resources at HHS could be used in more efficient ways to carefully review the studies that had been initiated.”  The FDA decided that the MSM group (men who have sex with men) was much less of a risk than those in the commercial sex work (CSW) and injection drug use (IDU) groups, even though the agency reported, “In 2010, male-to-male sexual contact accounted for 63% of newly diagnosed HIV infections among adults, and 78% of newly diagnosed HIV infections in men, indicating that male-to-male sexual contact remains associated with high risk of HIV exposure.” Further, the FDA allowed that “the available epidemiologic data in the published literature do not support the concept that MSM who report mutual monogamy with a partner or who report routine use of safe sex practices are at low risk for HIV.”  So why make the change? The FDA admits, “Although not making a change would maintain the current level of safety of the blood supply, as noted above… there is evidence that the deferral policy is becoming less effective over time. In addition, the policy is perceived by some as discriminatory.”  read full article at source: http://www.breitbart.com/big-governm...-donate-blood/

According to the FSB chief, experts analyzed passengers’ belongings as well as the parts of the plane. “After the examination on all these objects, we have found traces of a foreign-made explosive substance,” Bortnikov said.  “During the flight, a homemade device with the power of 1.5 kilograms of TNT was detonated. As a result, the plane fell apart in the air, which can be explained by the huge scattering of the fuselage parts of the plane,” he added.  This not the first time that Russia has faced “barbarous terrorist crimes, more often without apparent causes, outside or domestic, as it was with the explosion at the railway station in Volgograd at the end of 2013,” He added: “We haven’t forgotten anything or anyone. The murder of our nationals in Sinai is among the bloodiest crimes in [terms of] the number of casualties.”  But Russia won’t be “wiping tears from our soul and heart,” he said. “This [tragedy] will stay with us forever. But this won’t stop us from finding and punishing the culprit.”  Vladimir Putin has vowed to find and punish the culprits behind the Sinai plane attack. “Our military work in Syria must not only continue. It must be strengthened in such a way so that the terrorists will understand that retribution is inevitable,” he said.  The Federal Security Service director also announced a reward of $50 million for information on those behind the terror attack on the A321.  The Russian president asked the Foreign Ministry to “call on all our [foreign] partners” to assist in the search for the terrorists behind the attack. “We look forward in the course of this work to [help from] all our friends, including in finding and punishing the criminals,” he added.  Russia will act in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which provides for countries’ right to self-defense, Putin said. “Those who attempt to assist criminals should be aware that the consequences of such attempts will be entirely their responsibility,” he added.  The Kogalymavia A321 air crash took place over the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt on October 31. All 224 people on board the plane were killed, making it the deadliest air accident in modern Russian aviation history.  read full article at source: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheEu...3/wY9xyG2tSWk/

ISIL fighters blew up the Roman-era temple of Baal Shamin on Sunday, said Syria's antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim. The temple was one of the most important sites in the central Syrian desert city.  ""Such acts are war crimes and their perpetrators must be accountable for their actions,"" UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova said in a statement.  She also condemned the killing of Khaled al-Asaad, an 82-year-old archaeologist who had looked after Palmyra's UNESCO World Heritage ruins for four decades.  Abdulkarim said last week that ISIL had beheaded Asaad and hung up his body in public. Before ISIL captured the city, Syrian officials said they moved hundreds of ancient statues to safe locations out of concern that ISIL would destroy them.  ISIL, which holds parts of Syria and Iraq, seized the desert city of Palmyra in May from government forces but had initially left its ancient sites undamaged.  In June ISIL blew up two shrines that were not part of the city’s Roman-era structures, but which the group regarded as sacrilegious. ISIL had also used Palmyra's Roman amphitheater as a place for killing people it accused of being government supporters, according to a Syria monitoring group.  The Baal Shamin temple was built nearly 2,000 years ago and its inner area was severely damaged by the explosion, which also caused surrounding columns to collapse, according to UNESCO.  ""The art and architecture of Palmyra, standing at the crossroads of several civilizations, is a symbol of the complexity and wealth of the Syrian identity and history,"" Bokova said. ""Extremists seek to destroy this diversity and richness, and I call on the international community to stand united against this persistent cultural cleansing.""  read full article at source: http://america.aljazeera.com/article...war-crime.html"

John W. Vaudreuil, United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin, said 58-year-old Uri Fried, of Waunakee, was sentenced Wednesday by U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson for filing a false tax return.  Fried pleaded guilty on May 22, 2015.  Vaudreuil's office said Fried did business as a timeshare wholesaler. As part of the plea process, Fried agreed that his unreported income from this business between 2008 and 2009 was $1,980,035 and that he owed $706,636 in federal taxes for those two years.  Peterson rejected Fried’s request for probation and stated that a prison sentence was necessary to promote respect for the law and to deter others who may be inclined to cheat on their taxes.  http://www.channel3000.com/news/time...enced/34680620

If we lose hope on the European level, if we do not get enough on Sunday 7Fthen all options are possible as that would mean that we are on our own.'  He also accused Croatia of transporting too many people too quickly to Slovenia.   According to Slovenia's interior ministry, the cost of fencing off the 670km long border with Croatia would be about €80 million.   Officials said the country is too small and does not have enough resources to handle such large numbers of people.   Several European leaders are due to meet in Brussels on Sunday under the auspices of the European Commission to discuss the latest developments in the migrant crisis, Europe's biggest since World War.   Hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa have reached Europe this year, with hundreds losing their lives in risky voyages across the Mediterranean.  Most are trying to reach Germany and other rich countries. Croatia began directing migrants into Slovenia, which is part of the European Union's open border Schengen Area, after Hungary closed its borders.  But bottlenecks have built up along new routes and border crossing points in the Balkans, and aid workers fear the humanitarian crisis will deepen as winter weather sets in.  Slovenia has asked for the EU for assistance and officials said Austria, Germany, Italy, France, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland offered to send police reinforcements.   On Friday morning thousands of refugees and migrants were sitting in a field outside a small town of Rigonce near the border with Croatia as temperatures neared freezing level.  From there they will be escorted by the police to a camp to be registered before they continue on their journey to Austria.   'We have been travelling for 10 days and it was very difficult,' Abdullah, 23-year-old medicine student from the Syrian city of Aleppo, which has suffered heavy destruction and many deaths during that country's four-year-old civil war.  'I am here with my wife who has a heart problem and was treated by physicians last night. We plan to reach Germany to continue our studies and try to earn some money to help our parents join us,' he said.

1837045	2015-05-07 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	New Privilege Invented By Feminist Screwballs -Extrovert Privilege	False	卐 ☠ ϟϟ ✠ 卐 ✠ ϟϟ ☠ 卐	Crystal Winterfrost	"              I disagree with this. You shouldn't see this subject in such a black and white perspective because there are numerous layers of grey in-between. Everyone's lives and circumstances are different. For instance, I get along just fine with some members of my family and love being around them, but I absolutely can't stand some other ones and detest being forced to interact with them just for the purpose of keeping appearances and some family stability, but I will still avoid them as much as possible. Also, some people are probably just more self-aware then others. I can't stand it when people show up at my house before calling to announce that they're coming. If someone I'm not expecting and I'm not ready for suddenly shows up at my home while I'm in my pajamas, messy hair, unshowered, and in no mod for visitors then you can be sure that I'll stay locked up in my room and quietly beg for those people to leave ASAP, even if I have to give up breakfast or whatever just so I don't have to suffer being seen when I don't want to be seen and having to make conversation when I don't want to.   Other circumstances under which some people might be ""introverted"" can include the type people that they live around. If you live in San Fransisco or some other similar place and you're a decent, normal White man or woman with NS or WN views and you hate going out and interacting with most other people you come across outside because the majority of them are liberal, queer-loving, nigger-loving, YT-hating vermin... Would it make you ""mentally ill,"" ""extremely abnormal"" or ""unhealthy"" as you put it for wanting to avoid those people as much as possible? Maybe if I had lived in NS Germany I wouldn't have a problem interacting with the vast majority of the people I came across during my every day life, because we'd have so many things in common such as race, political views, culture, language, values, intellect, etc. But now a days a lot of people have a very hard time finding other people who they can bond with because of this jewed, modern, rotten, decadent, multicultural hellhole of a world that we live in now.  It's funny, I normally don't agree with feminist garbage, but the article in the OP does have some valid points. For the most part, ""extroverted"" people who are outspoken, unreserved, outgoing and very social do generally have an easier time making friends, finding jobs and keeping a social life. However, many of those people probably can't stand being alone or having no one to talk to for a certain period of time because then they might feel sad, depressed or lonely. Might even become unhealthy and emotionally damaged while many of the ""introverted"" people would be just fine under the same circumstances.            Originally Posted by Alyss   As a women, I know what men request and its disturbing and unnatural. The men always wants to be in the submissive position... That clearly is disturbing. No other animals mammals male species love being in unnatural submissive sex positions. Its gay and female like. But then again, since 1945 (even worse again) in 60's and 70's, white men had became feminised... And the submissive sex positions they request proves it.

Everyone knows this is the deal — just too gutless to say as much on the air.  Carson was on his way to kiss a little serious Jew ass in Israel, when accompanying reporter Jason Zengerle of GQ magazine (possible Jew) relates how he asked his Israeli guide: “In the United States, we have Republicans, Democrats, and independents — what do you have?” Zengerle said the guide explained: “Likud, Labor, and other smaller parties that animate Israel’s political scene and jockey for power in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset.” Carson then asked him “And what is the role of the Knesset?”  Carson also didn’t even know the three Baltic states were already members of NATO. He also said it might be easy to just “sort of slip” the Palestinians down into Egypt from Israel — like that will fix all the problems of the Mideast.  He thought former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was the Secretary of Treasury (God knows what he really understands about the Fed to begin with). He didn’t even know Greenspan’s name in the first place, calling him “Andrea Mitchell’s husband.”  And I don’t care if he was a neurosurgeon, either. There’s plenty of doctors, astro-physicists, professional people, etc. out there who might be reasonably intelligent but it doesn’t make them into great leaders. Plus, we really don’t know the real extent of his surgical work at all — often this kind of thing is a team effort and it’s doubtful we’ll have a lot of chatter from those on “the inside” getting reported, again because of “PC.”          http://incogman.net/2015/08/the-last...e/#more-121252

While the exact origin of the phrase is unclear, the earliest known use of the expression was posted to the /pol/ [1] (politically incorrect) board on 4chan on June 15th, 2015 (shown below).[1]  On July 28th, 2015, the conservative news site The Ralph Retort[2] published an article titled “Can’t Stump the Trump,” which lauded Trump’s ability to deflect criticism. On August 9th, YouTuber ZarosTemplar uploaded a montage parody titled “Can’t Stump the Trump,” featuring footage of Trump from the first 2016 Republican presidential debate (shown below, left). On August 26th, YouTuber Can’t Stump the Trump uploaded a video titled “Can’t Stump the Trump (Volume 1),” containing footage of Trump dismissing a Univision reported during a press conference (shown below, right).  On September 26th, Redditor Townidiot submitted a Facebook comment screenshot titled “Can’t Stump the Trump,” which refuted the authenticity of an image macro claiming the Simpsons predicted Trump’s run for presidency many years prior (shown below). Within three weeks, the post gained over 4,900 votes (93% upvoted) and 180 comments on the /r/quityourbullshit[3] subreddit.  On October 13th, 2015, Trump tweeted an illustration of himself as Pepe the Frog along with a link to a montage parody titled “Can’t Stump the Trump (Volume 4)”.[4] In less than 24 hours, the tweet gathered upwards of 3,000 favorites and 2,800 retweets. The same day, the news sites RealClear Politics[5] and Vocativ[6] published articles about the online reaction to the tweet.   read full article at source: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/can-t-stump-the-trump

They are continuing to approve the building of additional Jew settlements on Palestinian lands.  The Jew is genetically incapable of knowing when to stop and cut their losses. This is just more proof of it. Apparently killing thousands of Palestinian women and children was not quite enough for them.  From Fox News:  An Israeli settlement watchdog group says Israel has advanced plans to build or retroactively approve 1,065 housing units in West Bank Jewish settlements.  The settlements are built on land the Palestinians claim for a future state. Most countries consider them illegitimate.  Peace Now said on Thursday that an Israeli military committee retroactively approved 24 housing units in the Beit El settlement, though Israel’s Supreme Court ordered them demolished by the end of July because they were built on private Palestinian lands.  read full article at source: http://www.dailyslave.com/israeli-je...stinian-lands/

The fallout from the widening scandal hitting the white-shoe investment bank involves Tim Leissner, the Singapore-based chairman of Goldman’s Southeast Asia operations, who has left that country and relocated to Los Angeles on a leave of absence from the firm.  A state fund — 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) — was set up with Leissner’s assistance, and Goldman was paid sky-high commissions for bond sales. Then $681 million tied to the fund mysteriously turned up in the bank account of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.  The FBI is reportedly investigating all the fund’s transactions in concert with wider probes of money-laundering allegations spanning five countries.  These probes could force Goldman to face the wrath of a congressional inquiry, according to one legal expert.  Goldman Sachs banker involved in a massive overseas money scandal

The juden presse can’t realistically compare Russian or Iran to ISIS terrorists. Americans want ISIS defeated so what else can the juden presse do,  but try to glom on to the success of Russia/Iran in defeating ISIS.   One of the most important things Putin did in Syria for the jews was to remove Syria’s chemical and biological weapons. Weapons the jews have no intention on removing from their vast arsenal.    In the Yemen theater of war as in Syria, Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, israel and jewSA are supporting ISIS. Since Saudi’s el al are supposed to be the US and israel’s longtime friend and ally, a similar  conflict of interest was showing up in the juden presse.

Under France’s strict secularism laws, the government does not keep statistics on people’s religion or ethnicity.    But Robert Menard, mayor of Beziers in the south of the country, said his administration had used lists of pupils’ names to decide how many were Muslim, and claimed the figure came to 64.6 percent.  “Sorry to say this, but the mayor has, class by class, the names of the children,” he said on France 2 television on Tuesday night.   “I know I don’t have the right to do it. Sorry to say it, but the first names tell us their religion. To say otherwise is to deny the evidence,” he added.   His comments brought condemnation from the Socialist government, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls tweeting “shame on the mayor”.   “The Republic does not make any distinction between its children,” Valls said.    Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said she had called for a judicial investigation, saying Menard’s statements were “profoundly anti-Republican”.  “I am scandalised, sickened by these comments,” added Abdallah Zekri, head of the National Observatory Against Islamophobia.   “Moreover, you can be called Mohammed without being a practising Muslim,” he added.   However the town hall of Beziers denied on Wednesday that there was any list of children’s names or that any effort had been made to identify which were Muslim.   “The town hall of Beziers does not have, and has never had, files on its children,” it said in a statement.

After taking control of Fallujah, it has now seized the district of Nineveh (including the capital Mosul) and is pursuing its offensive in the provinces of Kirkuk and Saladin. More than 150 000 civilians have fled ahead of the jihadists’ advance.  On 10 June, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki called on parliament to declare a state of emergency.  The Islamic Emirate in Iraq and the Levant is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on behalf of Prince Abdul Rahman al-Faisal, the brother of the current Saudi Foreign Minister and of the Saudi ambassador in Washington. He is funded and supervised jointly by U.S., French and Saudi officers. Over the past month, he has received new weapons from Ukraine, where Saudi Arabia has acquired a weapons factory, and via Turkey, which has created a special rail line alongside a military airport to supply the IEIL.  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is an Iraqi who joined Al-Qaeda to fight against President Saddam Hussein. During the U.S. invasion, he distinguished himself by engaging in several actions against Shiites and Christians (including the taking of the Baghdad Cathedral) and by ushering in an Islamist reign of terror (he presided over an Islamic court which sentenced many Iraqis to be slaughtered in public). After the departure of Paul Bremer III, he was arrested and incarcerated at Bucca from 2005 to 2009. This period saw the dissolution of Al-Qaeda in Iraq whose fighters merged into a group of tribal resistance, the Islamic Emirate of Iraq.  On 16 May 2010, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was named emir of the IEI, in the process of disintegration. After the ""departure"" of U.S. troops, he staged operations against the government al-Maliki, accused of being at the service of Iran. In 2013, after vowing allegiance to Al-Qaeda, he took off with his group to continue the jihad in Syria, rebaptizing it Islamic Emirate of Iraq and the Levant. In doing so, he challenged the exemptions previously granted, on behalf of Al-Qaeda, by Ayman al-Zawahiri in Syria to the Al-Nusra Front, which was originally nothing more than an extension of the IEI.  The IEIL is based in Syria, where it occupies the city of Raqqa, the only city whose population was unable to participate in the June 3rd presidential election (together with the Syrians residing in France and Germany).  http://www.voltairenet.org/article184211.html"

2004039	2016-03-03 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	How moderates voted on Super Tuesday	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	Using official results and exit polling data for the nine states* that held their primaries yesterday, the distribution of self-identified ideologically moderate voters among the top three GOP candidates:   Moderates made up one-in-five (19.7%) voters across these nine states.   Compare this to candidate shares of total votes received among the four still in the race and Ben Carson going back to Iowa, where Trump's lead, while comfortable, isn't dominant:   Trump appeals far more to moderates than the rest of the Republican field does. He and Cruz are almost even among voters who identify as conservative. Rubio gets crushed by both Trump and Cruz among conservatives, but has almost twice the moderate support that Cruz enjoys (while Trump has nearly three times Cruz's moderate support).   Trump has the widest ideological appeal on the Republican side. Trump, the moderate extremist! Or is it the extremist moderate? Anyway, count this as another data point lending credence to Scott Adams' prediction of a Trump landslide in November. To the extent that the Trump-can't-beat-Hillary claim has any merit, it's largely attributable to the GOPe stabbing him in the back at every opportunity.    Hypothetical general election polls are unreliable at this point because they presuppose an electoral profile similar to that of recent presidential elections. Consequently, they are substantially undercounting the impending upsurge of working-class whites who will turn out if Trump is the Republican nominee (and they'll vote overwhelmingly for him when they do).   Don't mock Minnesota's nice cuckservatives. They've given Rubio a pretense for hanging around longer and his recent rhetoric suggests he wants to stick it out to the bitter end. He should!   Finally, consider Kasich's potentially VP position. For the last several weeks he and Trump have been hands-off one another, a drastic change from the barbs they threw back and forth in the earlier debates. Kasich has taken his can't-we-all-just-get-along chanting to an almost absurd level--the perfect complement to the Trump-as-a-loose-cannon caricature. The GOPe could reluctantly resign itself to a Trump-Kasich ticket. The markets continue to see that as a distinct possibility. Kasich is currently an odds-on favorite for VP on the Republican side.  read full article at source: http://anepigone.blogspot.de/2016/03...r-tuesday.html

An openly gay Texas pastor who had accused Whole Foods of defacing his cake with an anti-gay slur dropped his lawsuit against the grocery chain on Monday, issuing an apology that said he was wrong to “perpetuate this story.”  “The company did nothing wrong,” the pastor, Jordan Brown, said in a statement. “I was wrong to pursue this matter and use the media to perpetuate this story.”  He also apologized to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community “for diverting attention from real issues.”  Hate hoaxes are a real issue.  Whole Foods had forcefully rejected the accusations by Mr. Brown, 31, who claimed that he had bought a frosted cake from a store in Austin, Tex., and asked that the words “Love Wins” be written in icing on top — only to discover while driving away that a slur had been added.

Benjamin Netanyahu issued a furious response after UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said it was human nature for oppressed peoples to react to occupation.  Violence over the past four months in the region has killed 159 Palestinians and 25 Israelis, and Mr Netanyahu claimed Palestinian killers ‘want to murder Jews wherever they are’.  Yesterday, the Prime Minister said in a statement: ‘The comments of the UN Secretary General encourage terror. There is no justification for terror.’  Mr Ban told the UN Security Council of the ‘profound sense of alienation and despair driving some Palestinians - especially young people’ in the upsurge of attacks on Israelis since October.  ‘Palestinian frustration is growing under the weight of a half century of occupation and the paralysis of the peace process,’ he said.  ‘As oppressed peoples have demonstrated throughout the ages, it is human nature to react to occupation, which often serves as a potent incubator of hate and extremism.’  Violence since October 1 has killed 159 Palestinians and 25 Israelis, as well as an American and an Eritrean, according to a count by Agence France-Presse.  Most of the Palestinians killed since October have been attackers, while others have been shot dead by Israeli forces during protests and clashes.  Mr Ban condemned the Palestinian attacks, but said Israeli settlement building cast doubt on Israel's commitment to the goal of an independent Palestine alongside the Jewish state.

Gibson	              Greece's main problem is that they're crippled by being in the Eurozone.  That means the world can sell stuff to Greece for Euros, and use the Euros to buy stuff from Germany - the effect of that is to move money and jobs from Greece to Germany.  That happens because Germany is much more efficient than Greece, but even a small difference in efficiency/productivity would have that effect.  The best solution would be for Greece to return to the Drachma, so that when the world sells stuff to Greece, they also have to buy stuff from Greece.  Returning to the Drachma would also mean that Greece could set monetary policy for Greece, instead of having a monetary policy set for the benefit of Germany.  Why is Germany more efficient than Greece?  Partly because Greece has an average IQ of 93.  Incidentally, Hong Kong average IQ 107, Singapore 103.  BTW, this is not just a problem for Greece - all of southern Europe is in the same situation.

The tweet is significant because it was posted by Ashley Yates, who uses the handle @BrownBlaze on Twitter. Yates is a prominent protest organizer in the Black Lives Matter movement who is an advocate for violence. The Guardian quoted her in 2014 during her involvement with the Ferguson protest:  “If they can’t serve justice in this, the people have every right to go out and express their rage in a manner that is equal to what we have suffered,” said Ashley Yates, a co-founder of Millennial Activists United, who was arrested last week while protesting in Ferguson.  Yates learned organizing when she was the political chair of the Legion of Black Collegians at the University of Missouri Columbia; the group who was behind last year’s campus uprising there. Yates was not with the group at the time of that protest, however.  Under the title “Necessary Clothing and Accessories” the guide makes suggestions including:  Sweatshirt or leather jacket with a hood. This helps shield your face from teargas.

White men do not have same strength of desire for their own women, they have lost that eternal craving, that vision to even defend them let alone seek them as a vision quest.  This is what happens when the women are not virgins, just a fact.  No man will sail the seas or climb the highest mountain for sloppy seconds.  That is what motivates greatness.  But for niggers even a white whore will be a huge improvement.   As proverbs says , Where there is a lack of vision, the people perish.    Of course the money obsessed faggots think the niggers are just coming for the money and not the women.  There will be no money at the end of the day and no women and no white people.  They want money yes, as a means to fucking all the white pussy that is waiting for them to arrive to be fucked.  If it were not so they would be protesting more than they are.  The universe yields to the holy will, it yields to desire.    white men must teach these whores to respect the white males, any expression of desire to fuck niggers or in any way coddle them or help them must be severely punished.  They must be dealt with as evil children."

It’s also given us a frightening revelation that most of the mainstream media has been reluctant to cover. Apparently, Google was helping Hillary Clinton oust Syrian President Assad.  An email sent by the head of the company’s “Google Ideas” division to Clinton’s staff in July of 2012 reads “Please keep close hold, but my team is planning to launch a tool … that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from.” It goes on to explain “our logic behind this is that while many people are tracking the atrocities, nobody is visually representing and mapping the defections, which we believe are important in encouraging more to defect and giving confidence to the opposition.”  The email was addressed to Clinton staff members Bill Burns, Alec Ross, and Jake Sullivan, the latter of who described it as “a pretty cool idea.” One might also call it a pretty creepy idea. Nothing good can come from governments and mega corporations working together to sow chaos in the Middle East.

I hadn’t seen this, but apparently Tancredo told Trump to tone it down on immigration rhetoric recently. http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/tom-tancredo-donald-trump-immigration  Former Congressman and former Presidential candidate Tom Tancredo writing at Breitbart says it is time for a moratorium because we are at war:  Okay, “Muslim immigration halted in wake of Chattanooga terrorism attack” isn’t today’s newspaper headline. But it ought to be.  We ought to halt all legal immigration and refugee resettlement from Muslim-majority countries and declare an indefinite moratorium — until two changes occur. First, we must devise a better way to identify and deny admission not only to terrorists but also to persons who sympathize with radical Islamism. It will surprise the average American to learn we are not capable of doing that today.  The need for those new rules is highlighted by a recent poll showing more than 40 percent of Muslims in the U.S. would like to see Sharia law imposed, and an alarming number admit a sympathy for ISIS and radical jihadists.  Second, we must change naturalization laws to create a 7-year probationary period during which any new citizen of any religion or national origin can be stripped of citizenship and deported easily if the person demonstrates any support for radical Islamists.  Why do this? Because we are at war with radical Islam. It is time we started acting like we understand that reality.  There is more, continue reading here.  I maintain that it isn’t just terrorism, or the threat of terrorism, we should fear. It is colonization!  It is the Hijra, the migration of sharia-loving Muslims which will overwhelm us someday with their sheer numbers alone we should fear. Look to Europe! It only takes a small percentage of the population to be Muslim and the pressure begins for the indigenous population to change to accommodate Islam. It begins with just the smallest of demands: halal food in school cafeterias, special prayer breaks in the workplace, no alcohol or dogs in taxi cabs, a bending of certain laws to accommodate religious practices for family matters and women’s rights, etc.  As tragic as the terror attacks are for American victims, the greater tragedy is the expansion of an Islamic caliphate worldwide.  read full article at source: http://refugeeresettlementwatch.word...on-to-america/

I’ll give you the some details from the New York Daily News version:  North Carolina doctor accused of sexually assaulting at least 31 people, cops say, By David Boroff, New York Daily News, March 20, 2015  A North Carolina doctor sexually assaulted at least 31 people, authorities say.  Dr. Fidelis Edosomwan turned himself into police on Thursday after he was charged with 16 counts of sexual battery and 16 counts of sex offense.  The Charlotte doctor had been busted in late January for the sexual assault of two patients.  According to the initial arrest warrants obtained by WBTV, Dr. Edosomwan exposed his private parts during the examinations of the victims. He also “lifted the (second) victim’s shirt and bra and then rubbed her breast during a medical exam without the victim’s consent,” according to the warrants. [More]  Now, what I want to know is, why do they think of Dr. Edosomwan (full name Dr. Fidelis Iguodala Uwensuyi-Edosomwan) really a “North Carolina” doctor, a “Charlotte” doctor, or if you’re a local Charlotte news provider, a “Local” doctor? Is he, in fact, an American doctor at all?  The answer is “Of course not.” Dr. Edosomwan is an African doctor, who happens to be practicing in America.  Although he did his Residency in Internal Medicine at “Historically” black Howard University, his original training as a doctor was at the University of Benin Faculty of Medicine, Class of 1987. [Dr. Fidelis Uwensuyi-Edosomwan, Internist in Charlotte, NC US News Doctor Finder, no date]  That makes him an “African doctor”, a “Beninese doctor”, or an “immigrant doctor” for headline purposes, doesn’t it? Well, no.  You see, while I can find out that Dr. Edosomwan hails from Benin with the click of a mouse, none of the MSM sources have that information. A Google search for “Edosomwan and Benin” turns up none of the over 3000 stories about Fidelis Edosomwan in the news, it only shows news about other Edosomwans in Benin, where it must be a fairly common name.  So if I can find that out with the click of a mouse, what’s the Daily News’s excuse? Their computers don’t have mice?  read full article at source: http://www.vdare.com/posts/african-i...arlotte-doctor

Spencer is quoting Heraclitus at that point ""and man never stepped in the same river twice"". German philosophers, especially Nietzsche and Heidegger believe they are the ideological descendants and re-progenitors of pre-Socratic ideas. They suspect that Socrates, Plato and Aristotle made a fundamental mistake in the early origins of the philosophy of being (transition of ontical thought to ontological thought). Heidegger considered Nietzsche to be, and predict the end of that botched beginning and hoped that he, himself, and The Third Reich/Third Way would represent a the beginning of a new being and a new way of being. It didn't quite happen. Alexander Dugin, with his Fourth Political Position, and Russia as the Fourth Rome, hope they will be the heirs of this philosophical and political tradition.   Sorry, that was a mouthful and I needed to spit out quickly in crude form. The ideas I've written about above are implicitly covered in the new translation of Paul Gottfried's translation of Dugin's book, Heidegger: Philosophy of a New Beginning published by Richard Spencer's Radix Publishing.

QUITO Ecuador and Sweden have signed a pact that would allow WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to be questioned by Swedish authorities at Ecuador's embassy in London where he has been holed up for more than three years since facing sexual assault charges, the Quito government said.   The legal agreement was signed in the Ecuadorean capital after half a year of negotiations.  ""It is, without doubt, an instrument that strengthens bilateral relations and will facilitate, for example, the fulfillment of judicial matters such as the questioning of Mr. Assange,"" the foreign ministry said in a weekend statement.  Assange, 44, took refuge in the embassy building in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual assault and rape against two women in 2010. The Australian denies the accusations.                    Assange says he fears Sweden will extradite him to the United States where he could be put on trial over WikiLeaks' publication of classified military and diplomatic documents five years ago, one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.                    Britain, which has accused Ecuador of preventing the course of justice by allowing Assange to remain in its embassy in the upmarket central London area of Knightsbridge, welcomed the agreement.  ""It is for the Swedish Prosecutor to decide how they now proceed with a legal case,"" a spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office said.

Four others denied any connection to the killing of Nemtsov, who was shot four times in the back on February 27 while walking with his girlfriend along a bridge near the Kremlin in a brazen assassination that has sent shivers through the country's opposition.  Interfax news agency quoted a law enforcement source as saying that a sixth suspect threw a grenade at police who came to arrest him in the Chechen capital Grozny and killed himself with another grenade Saturday.  In Moscow, heavily armed masked police marched the five handcuffed suspects through hallways packed with journalists and into two separate courtrooms where they were ordered to be held for around two months pending the investigation.  According to documents read out in court, the accused are charged under a section of the Russian criminal code relating to murders carried out for financial gain, Interfax reported.  The charges also involve extortion and banditry. Investigators said they were still seeking others who may have been involved.  However, as in a string of other killings of Russian opposition figures, officials have yet to shed light on who might have ordered the late-night murder of the 55-year-old Nemtsov, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin.  Zaur Dadayev, a decorated former deputy commander in a Chechen police unit born in 1982, and Anzor Gubashev, 31, who worked for a private security company in Moscow, were arrested on Saturday in Ingushetia, which neighbours Chechnya.  They were both charged with murder but Gubashev denied involvement.  ""The participation of Dadayev is confirmed by his confession,"" said presiding judge Nataliya Mushnikova, according to state news agencies.  Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said he was baffled by the arrest.  More:http://news.yahoo.com/two-charged-ne...004552765.html"

Israel’s Cellebrite, a provider of mobile forensic software, is helping the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation’s attempt to unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California shooters, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported on Wednesday.  If Cellebrite succeeds, then the FBI will no longer need the help of Apple Inc, the Israeli daily said, citing unnamed industry sources.  Cellebrite officials declined to comment on the matter.  Apple is engaged in a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department over a judge’s order that it write new software to disable passcode protection on the iPhone used by the shooter.  The development could bring an abrupt end to the high-stakes legal showdown which has become a lightning rod for a broader debate on data privacy in the United States.

""He made a split-second and wrong decision, and he knows that,"" Gundy said during Oklahoma's signing day news conference. ""He is a super, super kid. And I use the term 'kid' because he still is like a kid. He's still very young.""  Mixon, who was the gem of Oklahoma's 2014 signing class, entered an Alford plea in his misdemeanor assault case Oct. 30, and agreed to perform 100 hours of community service and undergo counseling. Surveillance video showed Mixon punching the student, who police said suffered several fractures to her face and had to be treated at Norman Regional Hospital.  Mixon was allowed to remain in school but wasn't allowed to participate in any team activities.  ""Obviously he was punished, and rightfully so,"" Gundy said. ""There were things he had to do that kept him away from our football team and our locker room and our weight room, and it was hard on him. It was a tough deal, but he did a tremendous job. He did very well in school. He was working out on his own and staying up on that.""  Mixon is expected to flank Samaje Perine in the Sooners' backfield next season. Perine, who rushed for more than 1,700 yards and broke the Football Bowl Subdivision record with 427 rushing yards in a game, is the reigning Big 12 offensive freshman of the year.  Mixon, however, was the higher-rated running back coming out of high school last year. He was No. 53 in the ESPN 300; Perine was No. 220.  ""He's been like a caged tiger, I can tell you that,"" Gundy said of Mixon.

You must be a negro...or a jew perhaps.  Blacks are mostly ok?  Obviously, you are a troll.  Actually, if one looked only at work records of spics and niggers, one would most certainly have to choose spics.  Niggers ruin everything they touch, no matter what the field or occupation.  They are lazy, stupid, incompetent, belligerent, slow, dishonest...you get the idea.  They do not add anything positive or of any value to anything they do or attempt.  They truly are a useless, dangerous, race of creatures, really only suited to living in the jungle, in a fight for daily survival.   I'm sure we all would root for the large non human animal stalking them.  lol  At least some of the spics will work and are not lazy.  Now, they are not White and cannot and will not do anything to further the cause of White civilization other than providing unskilled labor in whatever field they are in, mostly landscaping and domestic type work.  If we could retain a small number of these mexicans who have proven themselves to be good workers and haven't shown any propensity for violence or substance abuse (do they exist?), maybe under extraordinary circumstances this might work.  I don't know.  They would have to be kept completely separate from Whites when not working.  When working, they would have to be monitered closely.  They would not be allowed to drive vehicles as they are absolutely horrible drivers and are frequently intoxicated behind the wheel.  Their culture is not conducive to our Aryan culture, as theirs is saturated in sexuality, especially as it relates to younger females.  This is absolutely not in keeping with White cultures.  We do not offer up our children to young males for sexual use.  And we do not sexualize our young girls either like the spic culture does, ad nauseum.    Niggers don't really have anything that could be called ""culture""...lol  They are simply low IQ creatures that live minute to minute, gratifying whatever need they have at that particular moment.  Art, music, literature, architecture, all foreign to niggers.  Their ""culture"" consists of eating, fucking, and sleeping.  And using alcohol and drugs when they can get them.

2004069	2016-03-03 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	Hilary Clinton: The Jewish Lobby's Candidate	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	DailyStormer.com  The New Observer    March 3, 2016  Proof that Hilary Clinton is completely under the direction of America’s Jewish lobby has emerged with the news that all seven of her biggest political donors are liberal American Jews—who all support Israel, which has immigration and social policies directly opposite to those they seek to impose upon America.  A review of the Clinton-supporting “Priorities USA” Super-Political Action Committee, published by the  Hill, has revealed that the vast majority of its $50 million war kitty has come from a group of Jews headed by the infamous George Soros, who has personally donated $7 million to the super-PAC.  Soros, who made his billions through “hedge fund investments,” is one of the far left’s top donors, and spent $23.7 million during the 2004 election cycle, when he became the top donor in the US. His “Open Society” foundation funds anti-white causes all over the world, including providing aid to groups supporting the current nonwhite invasion of Europe.  At the same time, his son, Alexander Soros, no doubt using his father’s money, launched a “Bend the Arc Jewish Action PAC” in April 2015.  Soros junior wrote at the time of its launch, in Politico Magazine (“What American Jews Want,” April 21, 2015), that “while Israel remains deeply important to many of us, the idea that Israel and Israel alone is what drives Jewish voters is false.”  He went on to say that “Jews are overwhelmingly progressive” and “one of the most progressive demographic groups in America today,” and that his new PAC would focus on issues such as “full equality for LGBT people,” “discrimination against other minority communities,” “rallying behind the #BlackLivesMatter movement,” and “fighting for immigration reform, risking arrest alongside our immigrant brothers and sisters,” among many other things.  In Israel, however, which is “so dear to Soros,” homosexual marriage is illegal, schools, buses, and residential areas are racially segregated, border fences and walls are built to forcibly keep out non-Jewish illegal immigrants, marriages between Jews and non-Jews are illegal, and Israel uses DNA checks to make sure that non-Jews do not immigrate to that country.  The second highest donor to the Priorities USA super-PAC is Jewish Hollywood mogul Haim Saban, who gave $5 million. Together with his wife, Saban has given more money over the years to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s political ventures than any other individual.  Saban, who made a fortune bringing the children’s TV show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers to America, is a “pro-Israel hawk,” according to the Hill—which means that he ardently supports all of the overtly racial policies implemented by Israel, even though he wants America to adopt all the exact opposite social policies.  Clinton, for her part, is also an advocate of all the liberal social policies—in America. When it comes to Israel, however, she is—not surprisingly—just like all her Jewish donors, “eager to demonstrate to her mega-  ----- snip -----   read full article at source: http://www.dailystormer.com/hilary-c...bys-candidate/

At least 300 foreign patients flying in from countries including Nigeria and Zimbabwe have been offered surgery before British taxpayers because their condition is deemed a priority.  The treatment costs the NHS up to £2,500 a time including translation costs but many patients return home and never pay it back.  Yet they are being fast-tracked by doctors as their condition is deemed very complex and urgent, leading to lengthy delays for British patients.  Cataract surgery is the most common treatment on the NHS and 300,000 operations are performed a year, mostly on the elderly.  Yet it is being heavily rationed due to financial pressures. Figures have shown that at least half of health trusts currently ration cataract surgery and some patients have been told their vision is 'too good' even though they cannot read or write.  Some areas including parts of Greater Manchester have average waiting times of 222 days – nearly eight months – while others will now only do one eye at a time.  Cataracts occur when the lens in the eye becomes cloudy, causing problems with reading, writing and general vision, which gradually get worse. But they can be easily treated by a simple 30-minute operation to remove the affected lens and replace it with a plastic implant.

That type of crime happens frequently. In fact, if you were to tally the number of young, White women murdered by Blacks in America since, say, 1955, the number would probably be around one million. If you suppose that at least 3/4 of those dead White women would have gone on to give birth to at least one child, that means that at least 750,000 White children were not born because of violence by Black men (and that doesn’t factor in plain robberies and rapes committed against White women by Black men).  To me, that means that any debt that we Whites may have owed Blacks due to slavery has been canceled. (Actually, you could argue that we never owed Blacks anything for slavery: it was, unintentionally, the best thing to ever happen to them. It took them out of the jungle and “civilized” them. Now there are Black cops, judges, mayors, even Black congressmen. If you doubt that slavery was the best thing to happen to them, ask a Black man if he’d like to go back to the jungle days of Africa. He won’t say “yes” – unless he’s stoned).    Read more at Vanguard News Network Blog...

Plus they don't have the jew dumbing their K-12 schools down and mixing niggers into their gene pool. If we were to filter out only the more intelligent members of our race vs. Asians, it would tell a different story. Our people would be innovating and they'd be following us around trying to find things to copy.  A lot of Asians share work with each other and cheat too. They're not as individualistic as whites, or care as much about making it on their own merits.  In fact there was a recent news article where thousands of them got busted for cheating. Here's one article, though it's not the one I was looking for: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/0...n_7167560.html (look at 'Goldberg' trying to cover it up) -- not to mention Asians benefiting from Affirmative Action and quotas.  I never saw too many Asians in the CS courses I took at University. A lot of the more intelligent CS and Engineering students I knew were Russians. But still the same applies, the few Russians that came over here and were excelling in STEM were of higher stock than the average American who was at school for liberal arts, or only there because their parents forced them, or because they wanted to party. Though there were plenty of intelligent White Americans (redundant) specifically in the STEM programs. There were a few intelligent Asians, yeah, but people exaggerate them dominating it. They're trying to flood the market with CS degrees now by getting more unqualified women or nonwhites into STEM, so you'll find more nonwhites but they don't really ever make it very far compared to white males/the few asian males who are actually competent .

False	Senior Member	Joe_Smith	"The difference between Jew conservatism and Jew leftism is only in the facades, the general agenda is usually the same.   Conservative facades tend to be WASP dinosaurs or Irish catholics. The WASPs are smart enough to know better, but do it because they have no shame. For money and props they'll put tassels on their nipples, bare their droopy middle aged bodies naked, and get up on stage to awkwardly swing around a pole calling for whatever new foreign intervention/demonization of boogeyman their Jewish pimps instruct them to. These are the ones that overnight turn Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, Islam, Iran, North Korea, Vladimir Putin, Assad etc into the ""New Hitler"" that needs to go.  The Irish Catholic conservative pundits tend to come from lower middle class backgrounds. They're obedient and kind of dense, their motive isn't necessarily money, but being the pride of their family.   With the Left, it's usually women, pedophile-faggots, or brainier/mulatto niggers with a personal axe to grind (and a white woman as a wife). This one changed actually. The Jews used to (circa 80's) find more moderate Uncle Tom types that would hold hands with Rabbis and ADL honchos in ""black-Jewish intercommunal dialogues"" and smoke crack in private.    Now they seek out mixed race blacks with inferiority complexes and let all discussion be framed by their psychological problems.   The audience is different, but the message is more or less the same."

Maybe because they were never trying to stop it in the first place? Via New Eastern Outlook:   Reports from pilots and sources up and down the Pentagon chain of command tell an interesting story. Considering America’s years of experience at “precision bombing” and the vast intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities of the world’s largest military, America’s utter failure in curtailing ISIS and her dozens of “sister organizations” has been inexplicable.  American pilots flying over Iraq and Syria have quietly leaked their story for over a year now but no news agency will carry it. They say they have flown over oil tanker convoys 4 lanes wide at times and been told to stay silent.  They report mysterious aircraft dropping supplies to ISIS and al Nusra, they are silenced on that as well.  Hardly surprising. Add in the fact that the Pentagon consistently airdrops ISIS weapons and equipment “by accident”, and one begins to question how serious this “anti-ISIS coalition” really is.   read full article at source: http://russia-insider.com/en/report-...eid=50f375c7ea

Also, the stupidity of the break-in is typical of blacks, as is the savagery of the attack. Blacks normally wind themselves up on drugs before they commit crimes, and that combined with their innate savagery, is why so many of their attacks are so brutal. The sight of blood enrages them, like sharks, and they go completely berserk. They also then rape the corpses as a sign of their mastery over the victim,  and when they rape women, they usually sodomise them, then rip up their wombs.  When you see images or videos of a black town after a battle, look closely at the corpses, particularly those of dead men, they usually have their pants pulled down or off.

(Rehash of SPLC)	True	News Bot	NewsFeed	The leader of a white supremacist website has started a legal defence fund after claiming the movement is “under attack” in the aftermath of the Charleston church shooting.  Don Black, who runs Stormfront.org, the most popular white supremacist site in the world bases on daily traffic, has asked members to contribute to defend against what he said was an unprecedented threat to its existence.  His appeal came after he was visited at his offices in West Palm Beach, Florida, by federal agents investigating the aftermath of the shooting and possible acquaintances of alleged gunman Dylann Roof, who has been charged with nine counts of murder following the June 17 shooting.  “I set up a legal defence fund because we are under threat,” Mr Black told listeners to Stormfront Radio on Tuesday morning. “We have to have have a defence. We are going to have to stand up to the government, which seems to be in lock-step with the media.”  Mr Black, 61, a former senior official in the Klu Klux Klan, reportedly established Stormfront.org in 1995 and was a pioneer’s in the white nationalist’s movement entry into the digital age, is one of several figures who have been questioned by agents in the aftermath of the shooting at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church.  In an online manifesto, apparently written by the 21-year-old Mr Roof, he talked about being inspired by things he read on line, and mentioned the Council of Conservative Citizens, another white supremacist group. The group found itself under further attention after it was revealed that its founder had made donations to several leading Republican politicians.  Mr Black told his listeners on Tuesday that he had only issued the appeal in the private section of the website, open only to members who had paid regular contributions. He said the other part of the site attracted 40,000 unique visitors a day.  “I mentioned it in the private part of the site. I thought people might be scared if I talked about ‘government cracking down’,” he said.  Talking of the government inquiries, he added: “The purpose is to dampen things, to shut us down. I don’t think that will happen. We have dedicated people. In two days we raised $2,000 and people are also mailing money to us.”  The Southern Poverty Law Centre, an organisation which monitors extremism and hate crime within the US, said it had obtained Mr Black’s private appeal to members.  It said that he wrote: “Remember this isn’t just about Stormfront. We’re just the highest profile target...Using guise of protecting Americans from hate speech, which ‘might lead to violence, the anti-White System is going for broke.”  The New York Times said federal agents had visited Mr Black seeking information about possible online acquaintances of Mr Roof.  Ryan Lenz, online editor at the SPLC, told The Independent that a report published last year linked 100 murders around the world over the past five years to people who had taken part in forums on Stormfront, including Anders Behring Br  ----- snip -----   read full article at source: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/wo...-10372833.html
1856665	2015-06-11 00:00:00	News & Discussion	This Just In	White supremacist Craig Cobb pushes for new enclave in north central North Dakota	True	Senior Member	James Hawthorne	"White supremacist Craig Cobb pushes for new enclave in north central North Dakota    Craig Paul Cobb speaks in front of his Leith, N.D. home about his outspoken White Nationalist or white supremacist views in this tiny Grant County town in southwestern North Dakota on Friday, Aug. 23, 2013.   By Brandi Jewett Today at 7:22 p.m.  A group of white supremacists is once again eyeing a small North Dakota town as the potential location for a community of their own.  In an email sent to the Herald, Craig Cobb, who attempted to turn Leith, N.D., into an all-white enclave, included a number of links regarding plans for the small town of Antler, N.D., located in Bottineau County two miles from the Canadian border.  Discussion on the linked websites indicates an initiative is brewing.  It's called Antler, ND PLE, the acronym standing for Pioneer Little Europe, a white nationalist movement which encourages its followers to relocate to remote locations and form communities.  Cobb says he hopes to crowdsource the project, raising about $70,000 to purchase property in the first of likely multiple campaigns.  ""We'll just try, and hopefully we'll have some success,"" said Cobb, who told the Herald on Thursday he's acting as a link between the seller and interested buyers.  The crowdfunding campaign has yet to launch on Indiegogo.com.  Antler Mayor Bruce Hanson, 63, said he hadn't yet heard of Cobb's intentions to buy property when reached by the Herald on Thursday night.  ""It's all news to me,"" he said. ""I hadn't heard anything. I know there's property for sale in town here, but I hadn't heard about any property changing hands.""  About 20 people reside in the town, according to Hanson, who said he's lived in Antler since 1980. He's been mayor for the past three years, his second stint since moving to Antler.  New town  Cobb first garnered national attention in 2013 when he purchased 12 lots in the town of Leith with the intent to turn it into white nationalist community. The town of less than 20 residents gained national attention as community leaders and residents attempted to push Cobb and his allies out of the town. The small community played host to protests against Cobb's plans.  He eventually left Leith after being convicted of felony terrorizing and menacing residents when he led an armed patrol through the town in November 2013. He deeded his property back to the city a short time later.  Now, his attention has turned to Antler, a town founded in 1905. The town is located 17 miles west of Sherwood, N.D.—Cobb's current town of residence.  Cobb said he has been negotiating with a seller for a couple of months and noted there are 28 lots and three homes for sale in the city. The town's proximity to Canada is something Cobb said he hopes convinces Canadians to settle in the potential community.  ""It's really pretty hard to stop anybody from coming into town and buying stuff,"" Hanson said. ""It's kind of a private enterprise thing.""  Online push  The Antler, ND PLE initiative also has a social media following.  At first, a Facebook page called ""Antler, ND"" seems to be a page for the small town, but the tagline ""We will have our PLE in North Dakota. UnityND will not be stopping us!"" is the first hint it represents something different.  UnityND is an organization that aims to confront hate and racism in the state, according to its website. A message seeking comment from UnityND was not returned by press time.  The page encourages those looking for looking for freedom speech, GMO-free food and the company of likeminded people to consider buying property in the town.  ""This new PLE effort, it's not about hate. It was never about hate, but we want to make it clear it's not about hate..."" the page says in a June 8 post. ""I just want to be in a town with my people, and only my people. Is that too much to ask?""  In addition to those features, Cobb said he'd also like to see a the town's crime rate kept low and an animal shelter established.  The Antler, ND PLE page is less than a week old and has 46 likes. Other posts include an invite to an officer currently under fire in McKinney, Texas, for pushing a 15-year-old black girl to the ground and links to new stories of crimes with white victims.  A similar Facebook page was created for the Leith initiative in 2013 and has drawn 1,875 likes.  A page administrator recently posted about Antler, ND PLE, urging followers to take action, as a related Pioneering Little Europe page has more likes than UnityND's page.  On May 10, the page posted a picture of Cobb holding a sign reading ""PLE.""  The Antler, ND page administrator did mention the failed Leith venture in a June 8 post.  ""We 'rayciss bigots' want to live with each other, we don't want to bother anyone,"" they wrote. ""That's what we wanted to do in Leith, and there was no problem until you guys came along. Hell Cobb lived there for a year without incident, so you can't blame him.""  Cobb told the Herald he doesn't intend on moving to Antler unless the city changes its law to allow horses within city limits.  http://www.grandforksherald.com/news...l-north-dakota"
